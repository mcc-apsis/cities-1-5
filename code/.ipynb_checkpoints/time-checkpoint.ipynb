      "The climate change research community has developed shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) that can be applied to a diverse range of climate research throughout the world (Moss et al., 2010; van Vuuren et al., 2014; O'Neill et al., 2014., Kriegler et al., 2014). However, the regional scenario specifically for cities is also increasing in importance since SSPs are described as being of a global scale. Based on the projected world's pathways which are defined by SSPs, this paper attempts to develop Tokyo's long-term socioeconomic scenarios. Firstly, important factors and elements were investigated through literature reviews, and then a basic theoretical framework was developed. Secondly, expert interviews were conducted to gather more relevant narratives and elements based on the theoretical framework.Three alternative Tokyo future pathways by 2050 were established. The Local Vitality scenario and the Efficiency scenario belong to the sustainability scenario in the SSPs, with a comparison with the business as usual (BAU) case. An important feature of such a city-scale scenario is to address urban form elements and infrastructure. The elements used for Tokyo can be applied for other cities. Projecting the future is fraught with a number of uncertainties, however, describing possible pathways can provide significant support for developing sustainable mechanisms for society as a whole. This work can lay the groundwork for developing further quantitative approaches to examine strategies for reducing environmental and societal impacts in different pathways. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

      "This paper explores the development and implementation of strategies for sustainable mobility in Basel, Switzerland. Basel (Bale, Basilea, Basle) has been identified as a 'relatively successful' practitioner of sustainable mobility, with an urban form that is not only conducive to walking and cycling, but also has an extensive public transport system and high levels of commuting using these sustainable modes of transport. With a low share of journeys by motor vehicles compared to many other European cities - combined with a legally-binding objective to reduce vehicle traffic by a further 10% from 2010 to 2020 Basel appears to be a forerunner with regard to sustainable mobility policy and practice. Five years after this objective was passed into law - following a public vote, as Basel is part of the Swiss confederation and practices direct democracy - this study aims to assess the extent of policy implementation and reflect on challenges and opportunities for the future. The paper presents findings from a series of interviews with stakeholders in Basel on the theme of sustainable mobility. Key questions include: is it possible to develop coherent strategies and policies to further reduce the role of motor vehicles and in doing so, achieve a modal shift? How does participation in a direct democracy influence strategy and policy development and outcomes? Do compromises and trade-offs mean strategies and policies promoting sustainable mobility are, like Swiss cheese, riddled with holes? By illustrating challenges and opportunities when advancing sustainable mobility in a participative culture, the study provides insights for policymakers and researchers in other contexts. Among the conclusions is an emphasis on the importance of committed individuals capable of expanding the 'strategy space' of processes. Participation provides one such opportunity, yet may also generate divergent or contradictory trends causing incrementalism. A rapid transition to sustainable mobility is thus likely to require increased politicisation of the topic by both politicians and civil servants.\n",

      "Mobility plays a crucial part of our life. Alternative fuels and vehicle technology can mitigate climate change and greenhouse gases from road transport. This study analyses power-train deployments scenarios for the vehicle fleet of the city of Athens until 2021, taken into consideration European policy developments on vehicle CO2 emissions and technological level of readiness, European emissions standards, Greece's economic status, energy mandates and reductions in the European energy mix and translates these into comprehensive scenarios for the road transport sector. It quantifies and assesses the potential environmental impact of these scenarios on CO2 CO, NOx, HC, PM and CO2 emission reductions. The study proposes the development of a Strategic Zero Carbon Transport Plan for the city of Athens, aiming at the creation of a low carbon transport system, which will encompass issues such as life cycle thinking, urban planning and energy minimization aiming at climate change mitigation.

      "Residential buildings in Greece account for about 79% of the exclusive-use building stock and consume about a quarter of the total final energy consumption, with space heating and domestic hot water being the main energy end-uses. About 58% of the dwellings were constructed before the 80 s and the adoption of the first thermal insulation regulation. This paper presents the results from the Hellenic pilot action within EPISCOPE. The overall approach and analysis are based on the national TABULA residential building typology for single- and multi-family houses in order to estimate heating energy performance and savings. The work exploits Census and statistical data for defining the Hellenic building stock and empirical adaptation factors to make more realistic estimates from normative calculations. The analysis is supported by a detailed data disaggregation in terms of the number of dwellings and floor areas, based on envelope thermal characteristics, heat production units, energy carriers, use of renewables etc. The calculation results are adapted for the building types and then projected to the building stock. Numerous scenarios for different modernization rates are assessed for identifying the most promising refurbishment strategies in space heating and DHW for reaching the 2020 and 2030 national CO2 emission targets.

      "Health-care waste management requires technical, financial and human resources, and it is a challenge for low-and middle income countries, while it is often neglected in protracted crisis or emergency situations. Indeed, when health, safety, security or wellbeing of a community is threatened, solid waste management usually receives limited attention. Using the Gaza Strip as the case study region, this manuscript reports on health-care waste management within the context of a humanitarian crisis. The study employed a range of methods including content analyses of policies and legislation, audits of waste arisings, field visits, stakeholder interviews and evaluation of treatment systems. The study estimated a production from clinics and hospitals of 683 kg/day of hazardous waste in the Gaza Strip, while the total health-care waste production was 3357 kg/day. A number of challenges was identified including lack of clear definitions and regulations, limited accurate data on which to base decisions and strategies and poor coordination amongst key stakeholders. Hazardous and non-hazardous waste was partially segregated and treatment facilities hardly used, and 75% of the hazardous waste was left untreated. Recommendations for mitigating these challenges posed to patients, staff and the community in general are suggested. The outputs are particularly useful to support decision makers, and re-organize the system according to reliable data and sound assumptions. The methodology can be replicated in other humanitarian settings, also to other waste flows, and other sectors of environmental sanitation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Various land-use configurations are known to have wide-ranging effects on the dynamics of and within other city components including the transportation system. In this work, we particularly focus on the complex relationship between land-use and transport offering an innovative approach to the problem by using land-use features at two differing levels of granularity (the more general land-use sector types and the more granular amenity structures) to evaluate their impact on public transit ridership in both time and space. To quantify the interdependencies, we explored three machine learning models and demonstrate that the decision tree model performs best in terms of overall performance good predictive accuracy, generality, computational efficiency, and \"interpretability\". Results also reveal that amenity related features are better predictors than the more general ones, which suggests that high-resolution geo-information can provide more insights into the dependence of transit ridership on land-use. We then demonstrate how the developed framework can be applied to urban planning for transit-oriented development by exploring practicable scenarios based on Singapore's urban plan toward 2030, which includes the development of \"regional centers\" (RCs) across the city-state. Results show an initial increase in transit ridership as the amount of amenities is increased. This trend, on the other hand, eventually reverses (particularly during peak hours) with continued strategic increase in amenities; a tipping point at 55% increase is identified where ridership begins to decline and at 110%, the predicted ridership begins to fall below current levels. Our in-silico experiments support one of the medium-term land-use transport goals of stakeholders to alleviate future strains in the transportation system of Singapore through the development of RCs. The model put forward can serve as a good foundation in building decision-support tools that can assist planners in better strategizing and planning land-use configurations, in particular the amenity resource distribution, to influence and shape public transportation demand.

      "The optimal design of buildings is a complex task involving energy systems as well as construction measures. Typically, in exact optimization models, only energy systems are considered, whereas envelope components are neglected. When considering both, heuristics are commonly used, which do not guarantee optimal or close to optimal results. Thus, this paper presents the governing equations, validation and exemplary usage of a building model suitable for exact optimization problems. The developed model simultaneously considers energy systems and building envelopes. It is based on ISO 13790 and validated according to ASHRAE 140 and further compared to a more detailed model. The findings show that the developed model largely complies with the ASHRAE requirements and is able to assess buildings' dynamic behavior regarding indoor air temperatures as well as hourly, peak load, and annual heating loads. The simultaneous optimization of energy system and envelope is further demonstrated analyzing retrofitting options of a residential building. We consider solely installing additional PV units, modernizing the building envelope according to German regulations and an optimization without constraints regarding building envelope and energy system. The results indicate that installing additional PV units can moderately reduce total costs and CO2 emissions. The envelope modernization according to governmental regulations leads to largely increased costs at lower emissions, whereas the unconstrained optimization is able to simultaneously achieve significant cost and CO2 emission advantages.

      "Flood events have become more frequent in Europe, and the adaptation to the increasing flood risks is needed. The Flood Directive set up a series of measures to increase European resilience, establishing Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMPs) at the level of the river basin district as one relevant action. In order to efficiently fulfil this objective, the involvement of stakeholders as well as the analysis of their roles, responsibilities, and demands has been considered to be crucial to develop FRMPs. As a result, the hypothesis tested in this paper is that a consensus solution for the 2021 update Austrian Flood Risk Management Plan is feasible. To demonstrate this, both in-depth interviews and questionnaires to key Austrian stakeholders are implemented. The information collected in both participatory techniques are then used to run a conflict prevention analysis. The results show that (a) improving the coordination among regions and including better land-use planning approaches are preferable to a hypothetical business as usual scenario; and (b) a consensus solution for the 2021 update Austrian FRMP might be achievable on the basis of both a deep discussion on the state-of-the art and green infrastructure development.

      "The State of Maryland aims to double its transit ridership by the end of 2020. The Maryland Statewide Transportation Model (MSTM) has been used to analyze different policy options at a system-wide level. Direct ridership models (DRMs) estimate ridership as a function of station environment and transit service features rather than using mode-choice results from large-scale traditional models. They have been particularly favored for estimating the benefits of smart growth policies such as transit-oriented development (TOD) on transit ridership and can be used as complements to the traditional four-step models for analyzing smart-growth scenarios at a local level. They can also provide valuable information that a system-level analysis cannot provide. For example, DRMs can provide ridership estimate when densifying either households or employment at certain stations to test the effectiveness of TOD strategies at target stations. In this study, the authors developed DRMs of rail transit stations, namely light rail, commuter rail, Baltimore metro, and Washington DC Metro for the State of Maryland. Data for 112 rail stations were gathered from a variety of sources and categorized by transit service characteristics, station built-environment features, and social-demographic variables. The results suggest that impacts of the built environment differ for light rail and commuter rail. For light rail stations, employment at 0.8km (half-mile) station areas, service level, feeder bus connectivity, station location in the Central Business District (CBD), distance to the nearest station, and terminal stations are significant factors influencing ridership. For commuter rail stations, only feeder bus connections are found to be significant. The DRM results have implications for agencies aiming to increase transit ridership through leveraging the land use near transit-station areas. The results show that stations with higher employment were observed to have higher transit boardings. Thus, agencies desiring to increase transit ridership should consider zoning regulations and site-design requirements that allow denser development around transit stations. However, increasing densities must be in conjunction with improved transit service levels, parking, and feeder bus services to take full advantage of rail transit. Some of the limitations of the current study and future research directions Include, first, that the DRMs were developed for the State of Maryland only. Future research should be carried out for surrounding regions to get generalized conclusions. Second, other important factors should be incorporated in the model, such as safety and transit reliability attributes. Third, more-detailed parking information, such as parking costs and supply, should be included in the model.\n",

      "By the year 2050, more than 70% of the world's population will be living in cities. The rush to the cities, along with subsequent increased consumption patterns, has dire consequences, for the ecological systems that sustain human life. Some find hope in the potential that cities can be built differently, that green infrastructure and denser forms of development will satisfy human needs while decreasing the stress on valuable resources and mitigating consequences of climate change. Some say that \"strong political leadership and robust governance\" is critical for this need to drive sustainable urban transitions. However, are \"political will\" and \"good governance\" enough or is the issue more complicated than this? Using a critical political economy approach this paper shows the fundamental difficulties that arise when attempting to transition urban centres to \"smarter\", more \"sustainable\" and \"resilient\" cities. Ultimately, the paper argues that \"good governance\" and \"strong political will\" are inadequate for understanding the requirements for transformation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

      "The reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emissions in buildings has become an essential field of study in the recent years. Simplified design tools, used in the first design stages, can be of great help in adopting concrete decisions that will, at the end, allow these to be reduced. This paper presents a new predictive model for office buildings in Chile. Starting from the 1,386,000 study cases pursuant the ISO 13790:2008 standard, 18 multivariable regression models have been generated, 9 for energy consumption and 9 for CO2 emissions., They have been adapted to each climatic zone in Chile. In these case studies, 8 fundamental variables have been considered to cover the design parameters. This research considers number of stories (NS), floor area (FA), form ratio (FR), window-to-wall ratio (WWR), coefficient of performance (COP), Energy efficiency ratio (EER), heating emission factors (FIEF) and cooling emission factors (CEF). The models generate an R-2 between 91.81% and 98.05% for energy consumption and between 96.83% and 99.56% for CO2 emissions, with the results of this research being incorporated into future regulations and into the first stages of design for office buildings in Chile. As an expected outcome, the model will contribute to reduce, or at least contain, energy consumption and CO2 emissions associated with office buildings in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

      "In many nations industrial scale AD of non-agricultural waste materials (such as MSW) has not yet reached its full potential, often constrained by the lack of secure, inexpensive, high quality AD feedstocks, and markets for the resulting digestate material. We tested the output material of a high throughput novel industrial process to define its potential as an AD feedstock (based on quality and consistency). This process, designed to circumvent the constraints of source segregation while still generating segregated waste streams, resulted in the production of a temporally homogenous fibrous material with: an average moisture content of 44.2 (+/- 2.33)%; C:N ratio of 32.9:1 (+/- 3.46:1), C:P ratio of similar to 228:1 and gross calorific value of 17.4 (+/- 0.29) MJ/kg((Dm)). This material provided a CH4 yield of between 201 and 297 m(3) CH4/tonneo((DM)) (271-401 m(3) CH4/tonne((Vs))) comparable to commonly used AD feedstocks. Material contaminant levels were temporally consistent (P > 0.05), (average values being Cd 0.63 (+/- 0.19), Cu 56.3 (+/- 7.45), Cr-tot 51.4 (+/- 4.41), Hg < 0.3, Ni 28.9 (+/- 5.17), Pb 79.2 (+/- 23.71), Zn 202 (+/- 44.5), total polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) 2.2 (+/- 0.3), and total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) (<0.2) mg/kg((DM))). Calculated digestate contaminant levels were below the median contaminant threshold limits for anaerobic digestates of all countries within the European Union i.e. of Cd 3.35, Cu 535, Cr-tot 535, Hg 8.15, Ni 185, Pb 397.5, Zn 2100 mg/kg((DM)).

      "China has been the world's largest cement producer and the cement production has led to increased energy consumption and CO2 emissions, which greatly affect the country's social and economic development. In this paper, an integrated assessment framework was developed by combining the Stock-based model and the Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System model of China (China TIMES), and it was used in China's cement sector to simulate the trends of energy consumption and CO2 emissions during 2010-2050, under a reference scenario and three carbon tax scenarios. The modeling results show that: (1) the cement production in China will increase from 1.8 billion tons in 2010, to a peak of 2.5 billion tons in around 2017, and then gradually decrease to 1.5 billion tons in 2050; (2) Through the adoption of three alternative abatement measures (i.e., switching the fuel types, implementing the energy-efficient measures and CCS), China's cement sector could potentially achieve a great reduction in CO2 emissions; (3) In the near future, the cement sector's decarbonisation will mainly rely on energy efficiency improvement; while the use of alternative fuel use and CCS will be of great significance from a long-term perspective. Additionally, based on the modeling results, we build the energy-saving and emission-reduction technologies roadmap for China's cement sector. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is one of the most important instruments for making relevant decisions on the basis of which spatial planning is aligned with the tenets and principles of sustainable spatial development. Its primary application is in spatial (strategic) and urban planning, as well as in the planning and design of sectoral policies in the areas of energy, water management, waste management, transport, etc. The implementation of SEA allows developers to establish the benefits and implications of the proposed spatial changes, taking into account the capacity of the space to sustain the planned development, and to determine the degree of acceptability of the proposed spatial changes. This paper presents a specific method of assessing the impact of airport noise as part of a particular SEA. The particularity of this method is that it integrates the objectives, indicators and criteria for assessing the impact of airport noise on the population using the method of multi-criteria evaluation, applied in the preparation of the SEA for the Urban development plan regarding the expansion of Tivat Airport, Montenegro. The changes in noise intensity within the planning horizon to 2030 were predicted taking into account the following factors: physical, geographic and demographic characteristics of the space, the projected increase in the number and nature of the flights operated within the planning period, as well as the types of aircraft. On the basis of these data noise dispersion modelling was carried out using the IMMI model, and the results obtained were used in a multi criteria evaluation as part of the SEA. The results of the research do not indicate any significant increase in noise intensity within the planning period to 2030 and they represent a good basis for making relevant decisions regarding the future development of Tivat Airport.

The purpose of this study is to understand the achievement and obstacles of community-based waste recycling through the solid waste bank (SW bank) program and its potency to improve the local MSW management in Indonesia. SW bank program is a unique organization developed among Indonesian communities to facilitate citizen participation in solid waste recycling. The banking system is adopted, and the community deposits the wastes instead of money. Case study was done for Padang city. The existing condition in 2013 suggests that the amount of solid waste recycled by SW bank activity was only 0.05 % of the total MSW generation. This condition results in 35 % waste without proper treatment. To improve the existing condition, development scenario is planned for 15 years. This development scenario may result in the increase of recycling amount of SW bank activity to 6 % of the total MSW generation in 2028. SWOT analysis suggests that some strategies such as creating a local regulation may be adopted to utilize the potency of SW bank for local MSW management improvement.\n",

It is significant to analyze how to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions in China's energy-intensive machinery industry. We not only employ a cointegration method and scenario analysis to predict the future energy demand and CO2 emissions in China's machinery industry, but we also use the Monte Carlo simulation to test the validity of the predictions. The results show that energy demand in the industry will respectively reach 678.759 Mtce (million ton coal equivalent) in 2020 and 865.494 Mtce in 2025 under the baseline scenario. Compared with the baseline scenario, the energy savings in 2020 will respectively be 63.654 Mtce and 120.787 Mtce in the medium and advanced scenarios. Furthermore, we forecast the corresponding CO2 emissions as well as the reduction potential respectively in 2020 and 2025. In order to achieve energy conservation and emissions reduction, the government should increase energy price, levy environmental taxes based on the emissions level of machinery enterprises, promote mergers and acquisitions of enterprises, and expand the scale of enterprises.

      "We carried out a life cycle assessment to model the potential for alternative household vegetable gardens (AHHVGs) to mitigate global climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) for Santa Barbara County, California, USA. Our model included changes in GHGE due to the effect of creating an AHHVG for five components: reduction of lawn area due to replacement by the AHHVG; reduction of vegetables purchased from the conventional agrifood system due to replacement by vegetables produced in the AHHVG; reduction in amount of greywater exported to treatment facilities due to diversion to irrigate the AHHVG; reduction in amount of household organic waste exported to treatment facilities due to diversion to composting at the household level for application to the AHHVG; and composting organic household waste for use in the AHHVG. We found that AHHVGs could reduce emissions by over 2 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) vegetable, but that results were sensitive to the range of values for the key variables of yield and alternative methods for processing household organic waste. In our baseline scenario (50% of singlefamily households with an 18.7 m(2) AHHVG, providing 50% of their vegetable consumption), AHHVGs contributed 3.3% of the GHGE reduction goals of unincorporated Santa Barbara County for 2020, 0.5% of the goals for the City of Santa Barbara for 2050, and by extrapolation, 7.8% of the goals for California for 2020.

      "BACKGROUND: By 2050, nearly 70% of the global population is projected to live in urban areas. Because the environments we inhabit affect our health, urban and transport designs that promote healthy living are needed. OBJECTIVE: We estimated the number of premature deaths preventable under compliance with international exposure recommendations for physical activity (PA), air pollution, noise, heat, and access to green spaces. METHODS: We developed and applied the Urban and TranspOrt Planning Health Impact Assessment (UTOPHIA) tool to Barcelona, Spain. Exposure estimates and mortality data were available for 1,357,361 residents. We compared recommended with current exposure levels. We quantified the associations between exposures and mortality and calculated population attributable fractions to estimate the number of premature deaths preventable. We also modeled life-expectancy and economic impacts. RESULTS: We estimated that annually, nearly 20% of mortality could be prevented if international recommendations for performance of PA; exposure to air pollution, noise, and heat; and access to green space were followed. Estimations showed that the greatest portion of preventable deaths was attributable to increases in PA, followed by reductions of exposure to air pollution, traffic noise, and heat. Access to green spaces had smaller effects on mortality. Compliance was estimated to increase the average life expectancy by 360 (95% CI: 219, 493) days and result in economic savings of 9.3 (95% CI: 4.9, 13.2) billion EUR/ year. CONCLUSIONS: PA factors and environmental exposures can be modified by changes in urban and transport planning. We emphasize the need for a) the reduction of motorized traffic through the promotion of active and public transport and b) the provision of green infrastructure, both of which are suggested to provide opportunities for PA and for mitigation of air pollution, noise, and heat.\n",

      "Determining the real energy consumption and usage pattern of a room air-conditioner (RAC) are important issues from the point of view of both RAC design and evaluation of its energy efficiency. An air conditioner's running time is fundamental data for the calculation of SEER and APF values. Therefore, in 2010, a nationwide investigation of RAC usage was conducted and 400 selected air-conditioning-units were monitored for a full year to obtain data on their cooling and heating usage. Two running time curves (cooling and heating) were obtained for the air-conditioners as a function of outdoor air temperatures using statistical analysis. The results show that the 27-30 degrees C temperature range accounts for more than 52% of the cooling time. Conversely, the 0-8 degrees C temperature range is associated with more than 75% of the heating time. The research presented in this paper has significantly contributed to China's new variable-speed RAC efficiency standard (GB21455-2013). It also has far-reaching implications for both the air-conditioner industry and energy policy in China due to its different method of calculating energy efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, transportation mode choice studies are currently limited to micro-level and regional-level boundaries, lacking of presenting a complete picture of the issues and the root causes associated with urban passenger transportation choices in the U.S. To this end, further analysis from a system perspective is required to investigate the interdependencies among system parameters more thoroughly, thus revealing the underlying mechanisms contributing or causing the low public transportation use in the U.S. Hence, system dynamics modeling approach is utilized to capture complex causal relationships among the critical system parameters affecting public transportation ridership in the U.S. as well as to identify possible policy areas to improve public transportation ridership rates. Considering the high degree of uncertainties inherent to the problem, multivariate sensitivity analysis is utilized to explore the effectiveness of existing and possible policy implications up to the year 2050 in the terms of their potential to increase transit ridership and locating critical parameters that influences the most on mode choice and emission rates. Transportation mode choice behavior is projected to change slightly and reach up to a maximum of 7.25% of public transportation ridership until 2050. Analysis results reveal that the effects of trip length and rate are by far the most influential factors. Both parameters are 99% sensitive compared to all other factors including the effects of fuel tax policies, federal funds for public transportation, use of alternative green bus technologies, increasing private vehicle occupancy rates, etc. on negative environmental, economic, and social impacts of transportation. This finding highlights how important urban structures are to secure the future of public transportation in the U.S. as the existing urban structures and the shared-idea in the minds of the society about how urban transportation should be (the prevailing paradigm) are the root causes of excessive trip generation and increasing average trip lengths. Thus a paradigm-shift, a radical change in the shared-idea in the minds of the society about existing urban structures, is needed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "The transition to more sustainable heating systems requires socio-technical approaches to strategic planning. Scenario development plays a key role in strategic planning, as the process supports the development of future visions and actions required for their realisation. However, new approaches to scenario development are required to address the limitations of conventional scenario development methods, such as the cognitive barriers of 'groupthink', reluctance to consider 'outside-the-box' options, handling of complexity, and ad hoc scenario selection and general non-transparency of scenario development processes. This paper describes the development and implementation of a novel method for scenario development and selection in the context of participatory strategic planning for sustainable heating in cities. The method is based on the morphological approach and a number of scenario criteria including transparency, reliability, coverage, completeness, relevanceldensity, creativity, interpretability, consistency, differentiation and plausibility. It integrates creativity workshops and interdisciplinary stakeholder participation to enhance the ownership and legitimacy of the scenarios. The approach entails the generation of a complete space of scenarios for heating systems and reduction of this space using cross-consistency analysis and project-specific requirements. Iterative development and implementation of the method is illustrated using two participatory backcasting projects focused on strategic planning for providing a comfortable indoor climate for Bila Tserkva, Ukraine, and Nis, Serbia by the year 2030. The results demonstrate that the method helps overcome the limitations of conventional approaches to scenario development and supports rigorous and transparent selection of a scenario set for participatory analysis. The method fostered the elicitation of consensus-based scenarios for more sustainable heating systems in both cities with regard to the quality of indoor comfort, environmental impact, resource efficiency and energy security.

      "An attempt has been made to develop linear regression models and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict the heating and cooling energy demands, energy consumptions and CO2 emissions of office buildings in Chile. The calculation of dependent variables to calibrate and evaluate the models has been determined starting from the ISO 13790:2008 standard, assigning constructive characteristics to each of the geometries studied based on the Chilean standards, studying 77,000 cases. A total of 8 fundamental variables have been considered to cover the design parameters. In energy consumption and CO2 emissions cases, the linear regression models that offer a better performance are those where the predictive variables have been transformed. Whereas, the multilayer perceptron adjusted over the variables without being transformed, provides greater accuracy in the determination of the demand, consumption and CO2 emissions both for heating and cooling, offering ECM values closer to 0, with an R-2 coefficient above 99%. It is foreseen that the models developed can be used to estimate the energy saving between different design outlines during the project phases when the construction standards, systems and internal loads are defined.

      "The concept of green building has gained rapid recognition recently. Developed by the U.S. Green Building Council, the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is one of the most successful green building rating systems. Understanding the performance of LEED certified buildings on various LEED credits is therefore important for practitioners and regulatory authorities. This paper analyses the use of LEED 2009 and investigates the credit allocation pattern of 3416 LEED 2009 certified projects. The results show that compared to its previous version LEED v2.2, the point chasing problem in innovation related credits is mitigated. However, energy-related and material-related credits remain difficult for developers to obtain. LEED 2009 certified projects perform differently in water efficiency at the country level. At the state level, the projects perform differently in water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, material and resources, as well as indoor environmental quality. Varied credit achievement patterns are also identified on cross-certification and cross sector levels. The study offers a useful guidance for practitioners to achieve relevant certification levels and for regulatory authorities to continuously improve the rating system.\n",

      "Low carbon energy supply technologies are increasingly used at the building and community scale and are an important part of the government decarbonisation strategy. However, with their present state of development and costs, many of these decentralised technologies rely on public subsidies to be financially viable. It is questionable whether they are cost effective compared to other ways of reducing carbon emissions, such as decarbonisation of conventional supply and improving the energy efficiency of dwellings. Previous studies have found it difficult to reliably estimate the future potential of decentralised supply because this depends on the available residential space which varies greatly within a city region. To address this problem, we used an integrated modelling framework that converted the residential density forecasts of a regional model into a representation of the building dimensions and land of the future housing stock. This included a method of estimating the variability of the dwellings and residential land. We present the findings of a case study of the wider south east regions of England that forecasted the impacts of energy efficiency and decentralised supply scenarios to year 2031. Our novel and innovative method substantially improves the spatial estimates of energy consumption compared to building energy models that only use standard dwelling typologies. We tested the impact of an alternative spatial planning policy on the future potential of decentralised energy supply and showed how lower density development would be more suitable for ground source heat pumps. Our findings are important because this method would help to improve the evidence base for strategies on achieving carbon budgets by taking into account how future residential space constraints would affect the suitability and uptakes of these technologies.

      "Active travel to work can provide additional minutes of daily physical activity. While the literature points to the relationship between zoning, equity and socioeconomic status, and physical activity, no study has quantitatively explored these connections. This study examined whether zoning may help to moderate any income and poverty inequities in active travel and taking public transit to work. Research was conducted between May 2012 and June 2015. Zoning data were compiled for 3914 jurisdictions covering 45.45% of the U.S. population located in 471 of the most populous U.S. counties and 2 consolidated cities located in 48 states and the District of Columbia. (Sensitivity analyses also captured unincorporated areas which, with the municipalities, collectively covered similar to 72% of the U.S. population.) Zoning codes were obtained and evaluated to assess the pedestrian-orientation of the zoning codes. Public transit use, active travel to work, median household income, and poverty data were obtained for all study jurisdictions from the 2010-2014 American Community Survey estimates. Associations were examined through multivariate regression models, controlling for community sociodemographics, clustered on county, with robust standard errors. We found that certain pedestrian-oriented zoning provisions (e.g., crosswalks, bike-pedestrian connectivity, street connectivity, bike lanes, bike parking, and more zoning provisions) were associated with reduced income and/or poverty disparities in rates of public transit use and active travel to work. Findings from this study can help to inform cross-sectoral collaborations between the public health, planning, and transportation fields regarding zoning for pedestrian-orientation and active travel.

      "Background: Older adults in rural areas have unique transportation barriers to accessing medical care, which include a lack of mass transit options and considerable distances to health-related services. This study contrasts non-emergency medical transportation (NEMT) service utilization patterns and associated costs for Medicaid middle-aged and older adults in rural versus urban areas. Methods: Data were analyzed from 39,194 NEMT users of LogistiCare-brokered services in Delaware residing in rural (68.3%) and urban (30.9%) areas. Multivariable logistic analyses compared trip characteristics by rurality designation. Results: Rural (37.2%) and urban (41.2%) participants used services more frequently for dialysis than for any other medical concern. Older age and personal accompaniment were more common and wheel chair use was less common for rural trips. The mean cost per trip was greater for rural users (difference of $2910 per trip), which was attributed to the greater distance per trip in rural areas. Conclusions: Among a sample who were eligible for subsidized NEMT and who utilized this service, rural trips tended to be longer and, therefore, higher in cost. Over 50% of trips were made for dialysis highlighting the need to address prevention and, potentially, health service improvements for rural dialysis patients.\n",

      "Cities worldwide have been trying to achieve a sustainable urban form to handle their rapid urban growth. Many sustainable urban forms have been studied and two of them, the compact city and the eco city, were chosen in this study as urban form foundations. Based on these forms, four sustainable city criteria (compactness, compatibility, dependency, and suitability) were considered as necessary functions for land use optimisation. This study presents a land use optimisation as a method for achieving a sustainable urban form. Three optimisation methods (particle swarm optimisation, genetic algorithms, and a local search method) were combined into a single hybrid optimisation method for land use in Bekasi city, Indonesia. It was also used for examining Bekasi city's land-use-plan (2010-2030) after optimising current (2015) and future land use (2030). After current land use optimisation, the score of sustainable city criteria increased significantly. Three important centres of land use (commercial, industrial, and residential) were also created through clustering the results. These centres were slightly different from centres of the city plan zones. Additional land uses in 2030 were predicted using a nonlinear autoregressive neural network with external input. Three scenarios were used for allocating these additional land uses including sustainable development, government policy, and business-as-usual. Future land use allocation in 2030 found that the sustainable development scenario showed better performance compared to government policy and business-as-usual scenarios.\n",

      "The efficient sharing of spatio-temporal trajectory data is important to understand traffic congestion in mass data. However, the data volumes of bus networks in urban cities are growing rapidly, reaching daily volumes of one hundred million datapoints. Accessing and retrieving mass spatio-temporal trajectory data in any field is hard and inefficient due to limited computational capabilities and incomplete data organization mechanisms. Therefore, we propose an optimized and efficient spatio-temporal trajectory data retrieval method based on the Cloudera Impala query engine, called ESTRI, to enhance the efficiency of mass data sharing. As an excellent query tool for mass data, Impala can be applied for mass spatio-temporal trajectory data sharing. In ESTRI we extend the spatio-temporal trajectory data retrieval function of Impala and design a suitable data partitioning method. In our experiments, the Taiyuan BeiDou (BD) bus network is selected, containing 2300 buses with BD positioning sensors, producing 20 million records every day, resulting in two difficulties as described in the Introduction section. In addition, ESTRI and MongoDB are applied in experiments. The experiments show that ESTRI achieves the most efficient data retrieval compared to retrieval using MongoDB for data volumes of fifty million, one hundred million, one hundred and fifty million, and two hundred million. The performance of ESTRI is approximately seven times higher than that of MongoDB. The experiments show that ESTRI is an effective method for retrieving mass spatio-temporal trajectory data. Finally, bus distribution mapping in Taiyuan city is achieved, describing the buses density in different regions at different times throughout the day, which can be applied in future studies of transport, such as traffic scheduling, traffic planning and traffic behavior management in intelligent public transportation systems.\n",

      "Sustainability transformation of the heating sector is recognised as being essential for reaching climate and environmental targets while improving the quality of life in cities worldwide. Participatory strategic planning enabled by scenario methods can be an important tool to guide this transformation, but methods for qualitative scenario analysis supporting stakeholder participation must be further developed and tested in the context of different cities. This paper presents results from integration of urban energy system modelling into the participatory strategic planning process implemented in the city of NE, which suffers problems typical of the heating sector in Serbia and the Western Balkans. The aim was to explore how the scenarios developed by local stakeholders could transform the NB heating system by 2030. Five scenarios developed within participatory backcasting project and a BAU scenario were analysed in terms of decarbonisation, energy security and energy efficiency using Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP). A final scenario \"Efficiency for the green future\" designed by the stakeholders for implementation in the city included high standards of energy efficiency in buildings, increased share of renewables in the heating energy mix, expanding the district heating system, deploying smart technologies and green architecture. The LEAP model demonstrated that this final scenario could lead to achievement of the desirable future vision developed by stakeholders for NB, through substantial improvements in energy efficiency and energy security, and to considerable emissions decreases by 2030 in comparison with the base year (2010) and the BAU scenario.

      "The building construction sector is responsible for more than 30% of the world's total energy consumption and almost 30% of its CO2 emissions. European directives addressing energy performance have opened up a number of possibilities for action as they have evolved from obligatory measures to opportunities for advancement Energy certifications for buildings and dwellings can illuminate many of the realities of construction, improve the efficiency of existing buildings and endow residential sector planning with a more realistic vision. This study examines the Autonomous Community of La Rioja a Spanish region in which cold winter climate zones predominate and analyzes how energy performance certificates can be used as a planning tool by calculating and verifying the average primary energy consumption and the corresponding CO2 emissions per square meter and per year for the residential sector. In addition, the differences between rural and urban areas are presented. The average primary energy consumption varied between 229.4 kWh/m(2).year and 309.4 kWh/m2-year, depending on the climate zone, and the associated emissions varied from 51.7 kg CO2/m(2).year to 72.0 kg CO2/m(2). year. This study is an initial benchmark to develop all that concerns the residential sector in La Rioja's 2015-2025 Energy Plan. The data obtained will enable different energy rehabilitation scenarios to be sketched out Based on this information, government agencies can determine appropriate policies to be implemented in the future. Therefore, this study is the first step in defining the actual energy consumption conditions for the residential sector in a southern European region. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "The performance of urban transport depends on a variety of factors related to metropolitan structure; in particular, the patterns of commuting, roads and public transport (PT) systems. To evaluate urban transport planning efforts, there is a need for a metric expressing the aggregate performance of the city's transport systems which should relate to residents' preferences. The existing metrics have typically focused on a measure to express the proximity of job locations to residences. A Transport Performance Index (TPI) is proposed in which the total cost of transportation system (operational and environmental costs) is divided by willingness to pay (WTP) for transport plus the willingness to accept (WTA) the environmental effects on residents. Transport operational as well as the environmental costs are derived from a simulation of all transport systems, to particular designs of spatial development. Willingness to pay for transport and willingness to accept the envirohmental effects are derived from surveys among residents. Simulations were modelled of Surabaya's spatial structure and public transport expansion. The results indicate that the current TPI is high, which will double by 2030. With a hypothetical polycentric city structure and adjusted job housing balance, a lower index occurs because of the improvements in urban transport performance. A low index means that the residents obtain much benefit from the alternative proposed. This illustrates the importance of residents' preferences in urban spatial planning in order to achieve efficient urban transport. Applying the index suggests that city authorities should provide fair and equitable public transport systems for suburban residents in the effort to control the phenomenon of urban sprawl. This index is certainly a good tool and prospective benchmark for measuring sustainability in relation to urban development. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.\n",

This study determined whether active commuting - walking or cycling - to school, as a way of increasing total physical activity levels, was associated with academic Methods: A total of 2138 students participated in the study, which took place in the 2012/ 2013 academic year in three Spanish cities. We used a self-reported questionnaire to assess how the students travelled to and from school and their final school grades. Results: We enrolled 489 primary schoolchildren and 1649 secondary schoolchildren, with similar numbers of boys and girls. The primary schoolchildren who travelled to school by motorbike, car or bus had better grades for all the selected school subjects (p <= 0.009) than those who walked or cycled. No significant associations were found for secondary schoolchildren, except for mathematics and their grade point averages. All models were adjusted for sex, age and school. Conclusion: Active commuting to school was inversely associated with academic achievement in primary school students but not those at secondary school.

      "Defining Car Dependency (CD) as a lack of travel choices to daily destinations, this paper explores how possible changes in the spatial context of a post-growth, mid-sized urban region can affect the conditions for CD. In the most rural parts of the region distances to schools and shops will exceed walking and biking distances. Distances to work will increase on average. With the bicycle and e-bicycle fewer jobs will be accessible, although the e bicycle shows greater reach than public transport. Despite the population and job decline, more jobs will be accessible by car, as a result of current investments in road infrastructure. This is enhanced by the ongoing development of economic centers along the highways, resulting in a growing mismatch between the rail system and the spatial economic structure of the region. We developed policy scenarios to explore spatial conditions for reducing car-dependence within the region. Intensifying land uses along the axes of public transport has a limited effect in a shrinking region. Introducing direct and fast public transport connections to the existing economic centers however does have effect. We tested two transport policy scenarios, one based on improving Inter City (IC) rail services on the existing rail network and one based on creating Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) services on the existing highways. The IC-scenario makes more jobs accessible outside the current daily urban system, while the BRT-scenario intensifies relations within the region. With regards to CD 'three worlds' seem to be emerging in this medium-sized, 'post growth' region. Rural areas (10-15% of the population in 2030) are increasingly becoming completely car dependent, suburban areas (65 -75% of the population) are offering travel choices to daily amenities, but increasingly becoming more car dependent in relation to jobs, and central urban areas (15-20% of the population) are providing travel choices to amenities as well as jobs, but only under the condition of improving the regional public transport system.\n",

      "Planning for sustainable cities involves supporting compact, energy-efficient urban form as well as maintaining attractive and liveable urban landscapes. Attractive cities depend highly on services provided by ecosystems, especially cultural ecosystem services (ES), which give direct benefits to urban citizens. Therefore, access to a diversity of urban functions and publicly available ES by walking and public transport should be considered when planning for sustainable cities. This could be facilitated by user-friendly planning support models. The aim of this study was to develop a GIS-based model for assessing accessibility to ES, more specifically, water-related cultural ecosystem services (WCES), via walking and public transport, with input from stakeholders. The model was applied to the Stockholm region in Sweden. Travel times and census data were used to derive measures and maps of accessibility to prioritised WCES in the region, today and in urbanisation scenarios for 2050. The results showed how access to WCES varied spatially within the region. The number of potential visitors to different WCES sites now and in the future urbanisation scenarios was estimated, and areas in need for future development of the public transport system as well as WCES were identified.

To calculate the building energy demand the EPgI was determined, i.e. the annual consumption per m(2) of primary energy. This paper examines the technical solutions useful to optimize the energy demands for heating during space-heating season and domestic hot water production (thanks to energy analysis softwares as MC11300 and TRNSYS) and, at the same time, to take into account the financial issues those interventions implied. The total inside heated surface of the building case study is 1204.00 m(2), hence the inside heated volume is about 3250.80 m(3). Besides the more traditional interventions concerning the building envelope and its systems, the paper examined the performance of a system obtained through the combination of a cogenerator (CHP) and a heat pump (HP), thus, substituting the conventional boilers of the buildings. CHP+HP solution increases the most the energy label of the building (from a D class with EPgl= 59.62 kW h m(-2) year to an A class, with EPgl= 25.64 kW h m(-2) year(-1)), determining an annual energy cost saving of 3,114 (sic) year(-1), allowing to amortize installation costs (54,560 (sic)) in a reasonable payback period, i.e. 15.4 years.

Following the Horizon 2020 climate and energy package, the volume of gases emitted by greenhouses has to be cut down by 20% by all the European Union (EU) member countries in order to enhance energy performance by 20% and raise the renewable energy rate to 20% by 2020. Solar energy on building roofs plays a crucial aspect in renewable and sustainable energy consumption of high-density human habitats. A merest energy should be allocated to provide hot water service from solar sources, as other European norms for new buildings by the Spanish Technical Building Code, similarly to other European regulation on achievement objectives. The climate zone and the overall demand of hot water in the building regulate this minimal amount needed. This manuscript use a new methodology for automatic detection of geometric patterns from aerial or space images using a Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) algorithm. In this way, an automatic method for the identification of building roofs in order to assess the opportunities available to install solar thermal systems in small urban areas has been developed.

      "The building sector has a significant share in a county's total greenhouse gas emissions, and as a reaction to the Kyoto commitment most countries are constantly adjusting building energy requirements in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the climate change. While it is easier to set standards for the building fabric and for technical systems, the impact of occupants on comfort and energy performance in buildings has proven to be important, but is a lot harder to account for. This paper therefore aims to investigate the magnitude of influence of occupants in relation to climate and architectural design on thermal comfort and CO2 emissions in offices in different climate zones of the world. The aim is to identify typical patterns and key parameters for optimisation.For this purpose, a parametric study for a typical cellular office room has been conducted using the simulation software EnergyPlus. Two different occupant scenarios are each compared with three different architectural design variations and modelled in the context of three different locations for the IPCC climate change scenario A2 for 2030. The evaluation of the results is focused on two different modes of operation. For natural ventilation adaptive thermal comfort according to ASHRAE Standard 55 has been evaluated, and for mixed mode operation final energy consumption and resulting CO2 emissions. The results indicate a first approach to estimate comfort levels based on climatic data, architectural design priorities and occupancy. Additionally, warmer climates seem to have larger optimisation potential for comfort and energy performance in offices compared to colder climates. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

Application of spatial data of different scales coupled with socio-economic data makes it possible to explore and test the understanding of land use change relations. In the EU-FP7 research project PASH-MINA (Paradigm Shift modelling and innovative approaches), three storylines of future transportation paradigm shifts towards 2040 are created. These storylines are translated into spatial planning strategies and modelled using the cellular automata model LUCIA. For the modelling, an Eastern Danish case area was selected, comprising of the Copenhagen metropolitan area and its hinterland. The different scenarios are described using a range of different descriptive GIS datasets. These include mapping of accessibility based on public and private transportation, urban density and structure, and distribution of jobs and population. These indicators are then incorporated in the model calculations as factors determining urban development, related to the scenario outlines. The results calculated from the scenarios reveals the great difference in urban distribution that different spatial planning strategies can produce, changing the shape of the urban landscape. The scenarios visualized showed to outline different planning strategies that could be implemented, creating a more homogenous urban structure targeted at a reduction of transportation work and thus energy consumption. This will lead to less impact on climate from transportation based on a more optimal localization and transport infrastructure strategy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

Data are collected via a survey administered to a sample of 2302 adult drivers in 21 of the largest cities in the United States. Almost two-thirds of the respondents provided incorrect answers to basic factual questions about PEVs and, of those, approximately 75% underestimated their private value or advantages. The vast majority (94.5%) of respondents were not aware of the current state and local incentives in place in their locale to encourage PEV purchase and use. Based on a review of consumer theory, multivariate models are developed and used to assess the factors associated with consumer interest in the two major types of PEV technologies, Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV). Results show demographic and attitudinal characteristics having the largest influence on interest in either type of PEV. Misperceptions about purchase price and expected fuel and maintenance savings are likewise significant, although their impacts differ between BEVs and PHEVs. Better informing consumers about already available public incentives and advantageous aspects of existing PEV technologies offer promising steps toward their mass commercialization.

To reach this goal and to assess more-realistic methods for animal replacement, we employed different in vitro experimental approaches: acute and longer exposure to LA, by direct and indirect contact (0-2mg/ml and 16mg, respectively), both in 2-D and 3-D cultures. In 2-D HECV cultures, we observed a decrease in the viability index, but only during direct contact with LA doses higher than 0.1mg/ml. Moreover, some striking differences in cytotoxicity were observed between the 2-D and 3-D models. Taken together, these observations indicate that, for studying pollutant toxicity during longer exposure times, 3-D cultures in direct contact with the pollutant seem to offer a more suitable approach - they mimic the in vivo behaviour of cells more realistically and under strictly controlled conditions. Thus, in readiness for possible forthcoming European regulations, we believe that the proposed study, even in its preliminary phase, can provide new advice on the assessment of the toxic and biological potential of particular chemical compounds derived from waste management processes.\n",

      "This paper investigates the financial incentives of load shifting under a time-of-use rate and Net Energy Metering pertaining to the solar net-zero energy apartment community, West Village in Davis, California. By \"smart-scheduling\" the electricity and domestic hot water demand of the dishwasher, clothes washer, dryer, sinks and showers solely to off-peak periods, the peak demand is reduced by 18%, the part-peak demand by 32% and the off-peak demand increased by 12%. With this shifted schedule customers accrue twice as many credits as they would receive under a non-shifted schedule with the same time-of-use rate, totaling to $2975 of \"free\" electricity per year for one 12 unit building. But, under current rates smart-scheduling is found to be worthwhile only during the months from May through October, when 96% of the credits are accumulated. If the rate schedule is altered to include peak-periods during the winter months, the credit savings will double again in value. These comparisons are prepared using two photovoltaic simulation programs (PolySun by Vela Solaris and System Advisory Model by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory) and for apartments using an electric heater and a heat pump for domestic hot water. By quantifying these savings, PV generating customers are informed that a time-of-use rate can benefit them significantly, especially if the surplus generation is maximized and sold to the grid during peak day time hours. With this information, housing developers can create effective incentives for residents, and utility companies, policy makers and designers of smart-scheduling household appliances can encourage a more reliable, clean and economical national grid.

      "A number of cities around the world are associated with very high levels of private motor car usage, and Auckland provides an example of one of these 'hyperautomobile' cities. There are many problems with this system of transportation and dependence on the private car, including environmental, social and city design dimensions. Though there is a clear aspiration to move towards reduced levels of car usage in the city's transport and spatial planning strategies, there are major difficulties in implementation terms. We develop and consider future scenarios to 2041 to reduce these levels of motorization, and subsequent transport CO2 emissions, with a much greater use of public transport, walking and cycling, urban planning, and low emission vehicles. The current implementability of such a 'sustainable mobility' future is however questioned in the current political and social context, and critically debated in terms of the available governance mechanisms and the limited attempts to shape the behaviour of the public. We conclude by calling for a reconsideration of the policy measures being considered, including the range and levels of application and investment; with a much wider framing of the transport planning remit, and carried out within a much stronger participatory framework for decision-making.\n",

      "The Facade Acoustic Insulation Index is one of the most disputed parameters for residential and non-residential buildings. The real performance of the facades does not often agree with the calculated one during the design stage. The field measurement sessions are usually carried out using pink noise spectra, as suggested by the International Standards ISO 717-1. In the present paper six mean spectra derived from in field measurements were proposed: urban toads, traffic lights, roundabouts, freeways, Highways, very high speed trains, high speed trains, and low speed trains. The proposed spectra were equalized against acoustic distortion and were used to measure the noise abatements in a terraced house and in a classroom facade. The highest abatements result for spectra with high levels at high frequencies, better absorbed than low ones by facade elements and frames. The spectrum adaptation terms were also calculated both for the standard and the proposed spectra and were used to predict the facade abatements in compliance with EN ISO 12354-3: the values C-j calculated from the proposed spectra provided more reliable results than the terms C and C-tr (ISO 717-1) and represent a useful tool to predict the noise facade abatements.

      "The Spanish economy faces two key issues. The first of these is the significant reliance on non-renewable energy, which reached 76.4% and was 22 points over the European Union average. Secondly, the threat that the fee deficit poses to the sustainability of the National Grid. This fact is forcing the Spanish Government to implement measures focused on tax increases. However, these decisions have done little to contain the situation. This paper proposes the use of sustainable transport models based on electric mobility: smart grids, buses, taxis and electric vehicles, in the city of Leon, Spain (135,059 inhabitants) as an important means for controlling and reducing the fee deficit. Through exhaustive analysis of EV (electric vehicle) market penetration against current Government forecasts, a rigorous profitability study has been conducted for the period 2020-2030 (when smart grids will be ready). By introducing policy modifications, the Net Actual Value internal rate of return and payback figures justify its implementation. Thus, the fee deficit of Leon could be reduced by up to 43%. Finally, an analysis of macroeconomic impacts, such as competitive improvements in the economy, and environmental impact is conducted. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "In Europe, energy and climate policies started to take shape from the 1990s onwards culminating with the ambitious 20-20-20 climate goals and the Low-Carbon Europe roadmap 2050. The European Commission empower the importance of achieving the objective of the recast Directive on energy performance of buildings (EPBD) that new buildings built from 2021 onwards will have to be nearly zero-energy buildings. The general belief is that the energy performance optimization of buildings requires an integrated design approach and cross-disciplinary teamwork to optimize the building's energy use and quality of indoor environment while satisfying the occupants' needs.In this context, there is a substantial need for professionals such as architects and engineers specifically trained and educated in integrated design approach and trained to work in cross-disciplinary teams. To be able to push forward the development, it is essential that educational institutions foster professionals with such knowledge, skills and competences. An initiative toward this direction is the EU-project of IDES-EDU: \"Master and Post-Graduate education and training in multi-disciplinary teams\".The paper describes the necessity of more integrated and cross-disciplinary approaches to building design through state-of-the-art of the building sector and educational initiatives in the participating countries in the project, and through theory of design processes. The paper also communicates the results of newly developed cross-disciplinary education established by fifteen different educational institutions in Europe. Finally, the paper explains and discusses the challenges encountered during development and implementation of the education across different professions and countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM) is considered to be one of the most serious environmental issues in the Philippines. The annual waste generation was estimated at 10.6 million tonnes in 2012 and this is expected to double in 2025. The Republic Act (RA) No. 9003, widely known as the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000, provides the required policy framework, institutional mechanisms and mandate to the Local Government Units (LGUs) to achieve 25% waste reduction target through establishing an integrated solid waste management plan based on the 3Rs (reduce, reuse and recycling). Although the initial impact of the LGUs is still very limited in implementing the national mandate, this article highlights the successful experiences of Cebu, the second largest city in the Philippines, in reducing its MSW generation by more than 30% in the past three years. This study also explores the implementation process, innovative actions taken by the Cebu City Government in implementing the national mandate at local level and identifies the factors that influence the policy implementation. The findings suggest that the impacts of the national mandate can be achieved if the LGUs have the high degree of political commitment, planning and development of effective local strategies in a collaborative manner to meet with local conditions, partnership building with other stakeholders, capacity development, adequate financing and incentives, and in the close monitoring and evaluation of performance.

      "This study aims to highlight the importance of thermal inertia in buildings. Nowadays, it is possible to use energy analysis software to simulate the building energy performance. Considering Italian standards, these analyses are based on the UNI TS 11300 that defines the procedures for the national implementation of the UNI EN ISO 13790. These standards require an energy analysis under steady-state condition, underestimating the thermal inertia of the building. In order to understand the inertial behavior of walls, a cubic Test-Cell was modelled through the dynamic calculation code TRNSYS and three different wall types were tested. Different stratigraphies, characterized by the same thermal transmittance value, composed by massive elements and insulating layers in different order, were simulated. Through TRNSYS, it was possible to define maximum surface temperatures and to calculate thermal lag between maximum values, both external and internal. Moreover, the attenuation between external surface temperatures and internal ones during summer (July) was calculated. Finally, the comparison between Test-Cell's annual energy demands, performed by using a commercial code based on the Italian standard UNITS 11300 and the dynamic code, TRNSYS, was carried out.\n",

      "There is currently a lack of harmonization in the building energy efficiency requirements that are mandated by different countries. Energy efficiency is defined by the energy yield of the facilities and by the envelope energy losses. These energy losses are mainly conditioned by the thermal envelope transmittance, the compactness factor, and the indoor temperature.This paper compares the requirements imposed on these three energy factors in residential buildings by various countries of the European Union (Germany, France, the UK, and Spain) and the United States of America. The paper also discusses the causes of the divergences in the requirements and their degrees of disparity. The paper further compares the requirements of the Passivhaus construction standard, which is highlighted by the European Union as an example of residential buildings with virtually zero energy consumption (nearly zero-energy buildings), similarly to the buildings that European countries will be forced to build by 2020.Within the current regulations, the thermal transmittance is the only factor that is used to compare the thermal insulation of buildings. However, this paper demonstrates that the thermal transmittance is not a valid parameter for the comparison and harmonization of the envelope energy losses because countries set different transmittance values for each climate zone, which are defined on the basis of different ranges of degree-day variation and are calculated using different base temperatures. Furthermore, this paper proposes a new methodology that can be used to regulate the thermal insulation of buildings to ultimately harmonize the envelope energy losses across all countries.

      "Turkey's energy demand has been growing by 4.5% per year over the last decade. As a reaction to this, the Turkish government has implemented the Strategic Energy Efficiency Plan (SEEP), which provides a guideline for energy efficiency policies in all sectors. The aim of this study is to analyse the potential of the SEEP on final energy demand in the Turkish residential sector until 2030. Three scenarios are developed based on a detailed bottom-up modelling approach using a vintage stock model to simulate the energy demand of heating systems and appliances. The results show a decreasing final energy demand in the reference scenario from about 944 PJ in 2008 to 843 PJ in 2030. This reflects a structural break, which is mainly caused by a high building demolition rate and low efficiency in the existing building stock. The SEEP achieves additional savings of around 111 PJ until 2030, while a scenario with even higher efficiency shows further savings of 91 PJ. Electricity demand increases in all scenarios - mainly due to growing ownership rates of appliances. The SEEP will achieve around 10 TWh of electricity savings in 2030 compared to the reference scenario, mainly through more ambitious end-use standards. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "The energy saving potential of the building stock is large and considered to be the most cost efficient to contribute to the CO2 reduction ambitions. Severe governmental policies steering on reducing the energy use seem essential to stimulate and enforce the improvement of the energy performance of buildings with a focus on reducing the heating and cooling energy demand. In Europe the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is a driving force for member states to develop and strengthen energy performance regulations for new buildings and energy certificates for the building stock. The goals are to build net zero energy new buildings in 2020 and to reach a neutral energy situation in the whole stock by 2050. More and more research projects deliver insight that the expected impact of stricter regulations for newly built houses is limited and the actual effects of energy savings through housing renovations stay behind the expectations. Theoretical energy use calculated on base of the design standard for new houses and assessment standards for Energy Performance Certificates of existing dwellings differ largely from the measured actual energy use. The paper uses the findings of some Post Occupancy Evaluation research projects. Is the energy saving potential of the housing stock smaller than expected and should we therefore change the policies?\n",

A scenario that involves adopting more efficient energy using practices and technologies is estimated to produce CO2 emissions 50% above 1990 levels, A scenario with powerful incentives for energy efficiency could lead to CO2 emissions 28% above 1990 levels, Much of the CO2 growth is the result of population growth and growth in energy services, especially in developing countries, Policy instruments to reduce energy use and related CO2 emissions include real increases in energy prices, aggressive use of energy efficiency policies, major programs to transfer knowledge, technology, and tools for transforming markets to the developing world and continued efforts to pursue research and development in technologies and practices to increase energy efficiency in buildings.

      "Objectives-To study risk of lung cancer among groups of professional drivers probably exposed to different levels of traffic exhaust fumes. Methods-A nationwide case-control study (1970-89) based on employees comprising 28744 men with primary lung cancer and incidence density sampled matched controls (1:1). Employment histories were reconstructed back to 1964 for each study subject from the records of a nationwide pension scheme with compulsory membership. Socioeconomic status was derived from the individual job title taken from the national population registry. Information on tobacco smoking habits was available from historical surveys. Relative risks were estimated by odds ratios (ORs) based on conditional logistic regression analyses. Results-In total 2251 of the male lung cancer cases had been employed as bus, lorry, taxi, or unspecified drivers. No significant difference in tobacco smoking habits was found among professional male Danish drivers and the total employed population. The OR for lung cancer adjusted for socioeconomic status was 1.6 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.2 to 2.2) among taxi drivers, who were considered to be exposed to the highest concentrations of vehicle exhaust fumes, and 1.3 (1.2 to 1.5) for bus and lorry drivers. The OR was 1.4 (1.3 to 1.5) for unspecified drivers. The adjusted risk of lung cancer increased significantly with increasing duration of employment as a driver, and the risk was highest for long term taxi drivers with 10 years of lag time (OR 3.0; 1.2 to 6.8). Conclusion-Occupational factors, probably exposure to vehicle exhaust, seems to play an important part in the development of lung cancer among drivers.\n",

      "As government and industry plan to reduce energy consumption in building stock, there is a need to forecast the uptake of retrofit packages across building stock over time. To address this challenge a diffusion model was set up and applied to office building stock across New South Wales (NSW) in Australia, accommodating a high spatial resolution and temporal capability for projecting uptake of technology packages characterised by multiple variables. Six retrofit packages were set up for the diffusion model, which ranged from inexpensive services and manuals through to mid-priced packages involving energy efficient T5 lighting and solar hot water through to expensive packages such as chilled beams and Solar PV. We evaluated the model using a base case and two policy programs, representing the Green Building Fund and Environmental Upgrade Agreements. These were recent incentive programs funded by the Australian government to accelerate the uptake of retrofit packages, by providing financial support to upfront expenditures and removing barriers to retrofit. By forecasting uptake of each retrofit package to 2032 under each program, we demonstrate how the model can be a valuable resource in tailoring expensive government programs and increasing their effectiveness.

      "The building sector is the dominant energy consumer with a total 30% share of the overall energy consumption and accounts for one-third of the greenhouse gas emissions around the world. Moreover, in recent years the energy demands for buildings have increased very rapidly due to increase in the growth rate of population and improvement in living standards of people. Furthermore, fossil fuels will continue to dominate the world's primary energy by 2030. Thus, the increase in energy demand, shortage of fossil fuels and environmental concerns has provided impetus to the development of sustainable building and renewable energy resources. Thermal energy storage is an efficient method for applying to building envelopes to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. This, in turn, reduces the environmental impact related to energy usage.The combination of construction materials and PCM is an efficient way to increase the thermal energy storage capacity of construction elements. Therefore, an extensive review on the incorporation of PCM into construction materials and elements by direct incorporation, immersion, encapsulation, shape-stabilization and form-stable composite PCMs is presented. For the first time, the differentiation between shape-stabilized and form-stable composite PCM has been made. Moreover, various construction materials such as diatomite, expanded perlite and graphite, etc. which are used as supports for formstable composite PCM along with their worldwide availability are extensively discussed. One of the main aims of this review paper is to focus on the test methods which are used to determine the chemical compatibility, thermal properties, thermal stability and thermal conductivity of the PCM. Hence, the details related to calibration, sample preparation, test cell and analysis of test results are comprehensively covered. Finally, because of the renewed interest in integration of PCM in wallboards and concrete, an up-to-date review with focus on PCM enhanced wallboard and concrete for building applications is added.

      "The Energy Performance Buildings Directive (EPBD) was issued to provide a common strategy for all European countries and to implement several actions for improving energy efficiency of buildings, responsible for 40% of energy consumption. Energy Performance Certificates are provided as a tool to evaluate the energy performance of buildings; however, costly and time-consuming controls are necessary to verify the accuracy of the set and declared data. Useful tools could be the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), whereby it is possible to estimate the energy consumptions from specific parameters, to evaluate the accuracy of data in the energy certificates, and to identify the certificates needing accurate control. In this study, an Artificial Neural Network was developed based on approximately 6500 energy certificates (2700 are self-declaration) received by the Umbria Region (central Italy), in order to evaluate the global energy consumption of buildings from several and specific parameters reported in certificates. Data was checked in compliance with energy standards and only the correct certificates were used to train the Neural Network. The implemented Neural Network was tested with database data and a good correlation was found; in particular the energy performance calculated with the Neural Network presents an error greater than 15 kW h/m(2) year with respect to the real value of global energy performance index in only 3.6% of cases. Finally, a Neural Energy Performance Index (N.E.P.I.) was defined, in order to verify the accuracy of the energy certificates; the study reported in this paper shows how the new defined index could be an important tool to identify which energy certificates require controls. A refinement of the Neural Network would allow to minimize the error and to define a N.E.P.I. index that could be used by European public administrations as a tool to perform an initial check of certificates.

      "By considering the energy efficiency legislations among the European Union, Turkey is responsible to provide regulations to comply for the latest European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive 2010/31/EC. New legislation in Turkey requires information about the evaluation of energy performance of existing buildings. This study aimed to determine energy performance of residential buildings in Izmir, regarding significant relationships between their performance and architectural configuration through statistical analysis. The focus was on the heating energy consumption due to Energy Efficiency Law (2007) and Building Energy Performance Regulation (2008), and Standard Assessment Method for Energy Performance of Dwellings (KEP-SDM). This energy performance assessment method was based on Turkish standard TS 825, and European standard EN ISO 13790. It is known that architectural configuration of buildings and design norms have impact on energy performance of buildings. However, emphasis was given on significant values of architectural considerations through certain area-based ratios. The levels of these ratios were matched with the levels of energy consumption. By this, the consideration was to take early-precautions against high energy consumptions in the early design stage and to enhance legislation by adding recommendations of concrete architectural values. These would assist to predict the level of energy performance in the early design phase. Findings would provide feedback information on the residential building stock in Izmir, Turkey.

      "The transportation sector faces increasing challenges related to energy consumption and local and global emissions profiles. Thus, alternative vehicle technologies and energy pathways are being considered in order to overturn this trend and electric mobility is considered one adequate possibility towards a more sustainable transportation sector.In this sense, this research work consisted on the development of a methodology to assess the economic feasibility of deploying EV charging stations (Park-EV) by quantifying the tradeoff between economic and energy/environmental impacts for EV parking spaces deployment. This methodology was applied to 4 different cities (Lisbon, Madrid, Minneapolis and Manhattan), by evaluating the influence of parking premium, infrastructure cost and occupancy rates on the investment Net Present Value (NPV). The main findings are that the maximization of the premium and the minimization of the equipment cost lead to higher NPV results. The NPV break-even for the cities considered is more \"easily\" reached for higher parking prices, namely in the case of Manhattan with the higher parking price profile. In terms of evaluating occupancy rates of the EV parking spaces, shifting from a low usage (LU) to a high usage (HU) scenario represented a reduction in the premium to obtain a NPV = 0 of approximately 14% for a 2500 epsilon equipment cost, and, in the case of a zero equipment cost (e.g. financed by the city), a NPV = 0 was obtained with approximately a 2% reduction in the parking premium. Moreover, due to the use of electric mobility instead of the average conventional technologies, Well-to-Wheel (WTW) gains for Lisbon, Madrid, Minneapolis and Manhattan were estimated in 58%, 53%, 52% and 75% for energy consumption and 66%, 75%, 62% and 86% for CO2 emissions, respectively.This research confirms that the success of deploying an EV charging stations infrastructure will be highly dependent on the price the user will have to pay, on the cost of the infrastructure deployed and on the adhesion of the EV users to this kind of infrastructure. These variables are not independent and, consequently, the coordination of public policies and private interest must be promoted in order to reach an optimal solution that does not result in prohibitive costs for the users.

This paper analyses the effects of transitional spaces on energy performance and indoor thermal comfort of low-rise dwellings in the Netherlands, at present and projected in 2050. For this analysis the four climate scenarios for 2050 from the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute (KNMI) were used. Including a courtyard within a Dutch terraced dwelling on the one hand showed an increase in annual heating energy demand but on the other hand a decrease in the number of summer discomfort hours. An atrium integrated into a Dutch terraced dwelling reduced the heating demand but increased the number of discomfort hours in summer. Analysing the monthly energy performance, comfort hours and the climate scenarios indicated that using an open courtyard May through October and an atrium, i.e. a covered courtyard, in the rest of the year establishes an optimum balance between energy use and summer comfort for the severest climate scenario.

The two scenarios were based on economic suitability and environmental suitability. A key question was whether these occurred together in the Pennypack Creek Watershed. Suitability analyses in ArcGIS using criteria for profit and for local sustainability parsed out two sets of developable areas. Buildouts to satisfy 2035 population projections in these areas using CommunityViz software were based on actual municipal zoning ordinances. In a unified zoning scheme created by the authors, a density-adjusted number of housing units are placed watershed-wide without municipal restrictions. Profit data for buildings in each zip code were used to compute a Weighted Profit per Square Meter. Household units were associated with a particular type of automobile and average Vehicle Kilometers Traveled in the relevant census tracts. The GREET program was used to compute energy use, air pollution emissions and greenhouse gas emissions. A Weighted Water Quality Index and Index of Biological Integrity were used to assess water-related impacts based on recent monitoring data supplied by the Philadelphia Water Department. It was no surprise that ECON-UNI and ECON-MUNI generated higher profit than ENV-MUNI and ENV-UNI. ENV-UNI had lower energy use and environmental impacts than all others.

In this paper, the emission reductions and health cost savings are presented for moving to cleaner brick manufacturing technologies for the districts of Gazipur, Savar, Dhamrai, Rupganj, Manikganj, Kaliganj, and Narayanganj. A summary of various technologies and feasibility of these technologies based on lessons learnt from the pilots is discussed. We explored three \"what-if\" scenarios through 2020 for better energy efficiency, lower coal consumption, and lower emission rates, under which the total health cost savings are estimated to range between USD12 million annually for short-term implementation and up to 55 million annually for long-term implementation. Between 2015 and 2020, the cumulative health cost savings could range between USD126 and 234 million, which clearly outweigh any cost of capital investment necessary for the technology change. An improvement in energy efficiency will result in USD1.8 to 3.0 million per year in coal savings, which will accrue to the kiln owners collectively, and these savings will pay back the capital investment within 3-4 years, in addition to the health cost savings for the city inhabitants. Hence, the entrepreneurs have all the social, environmental, and economic incentives to adopt cleaner technologies. A major gap at the regulatory level is in building awareness for the entrepreneurs and setting up an incentive structure to implement this transition, which is being addressed by an advisory committee by the Government of Bangladesh responsible for the revision of the Brick Burning Act of 1989 and related legislations.\n",

      "The Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme (LATS) is one of the main instruments used in England to enforce the landfill diversion targets established in the Directive 1999/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 April 1999 on the landfill of waste (Landfill Directive). Through the LATS, biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) allowances for landfilling are allocated to each local authority, otherwise known as waste disposal authorities (WDAs). The quantity of landfill allowances received is expected to decrease continuously from 2005/06 to 2019/20 so as to meet the objectives of the Landfill Directive. To achieve their commitments, WDAs can exchange, buy, sell or transfer allowances among each other, or may reprofile their own allocation through banking and/or borrowing. Despite the goals for the first seven years - which included two target years (2005/06 and 2009/10) - being widely achieved (the average allocation of allowances per WDA was 22.9% higher than those finally used), market activity among WDAs was high and prices were not very stable. Results in terms of waste reduction and recycling levels have been satisfactory. The reduction of BMW landfilled (in percentage) was higher during the first seven years of the LATS period (2005/06-2011/12) (around 7% annually) than during the previous period (2001/02-2004/05) (4.2% annually). Since 2008, the significance of the LATS diminished because of an increase in the rate of the UK Landfill Tax. The LATS was suppressed after the 2012/13 target year, before what it was initially scheduled. The purpose of this paper is to describe the particularities of the LATS, analyse its performance as a waste management policy, make a comparison with the Landfill Tax, discuss its main features as regards efficiency, effectiveness and the application of the \"polluter pays\" principle and finally discuss if the effect of the increase in the Landfill Tax is what made the LATS ultimately unnecessary.

      "This paper presents passenger road transport scenarios that may assist the MCMA (Mexico City Metropolitan Area) in achieving lower emissions in both criteria air pollutants (CO, NOx, NMVOC (non-methane volatile organic compounds), and PM10) and GHG (greenhouse gas) (CH4, N2O and CO2), while also promoting better mobility and quality of life in this region. We developed a bottom-up model to estimate the historical trends of energy demand, criteria air pollutants and GHG emissions caused by passenger vehicles circulating in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) in order to construct a baseline scenario and two mitigation scenarios that project their impact to 2028. Mitigation scenario \"eff\" considers increasing fuel efficiencies and introducing new technologies for vehicle emission controls. Mitigation scenario \"BRT\" considers a modal shift from private car trips to a Bus Rapid Transport system. Our results show significant reductions in air pollutants and GHG emissions. Incentives and environmental regulations are needed to enable these scenarios. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Environmental pressure from residential energy use is projected to significantly increase by 2030. Different environmental policy measures provide different incentives for \"environmentally responsive\" consumer choices and behavioural responses. There is a great energy saving potential in residential buildings of Lithuania. Compared to the other EU countries with similar climate conditions, energy consumption for residential heating is approximately 1.8 times higher in Lithuania. About 60% of Lithuanian population resides in multi-apartment buildings constructed during 1961-1990. The aim of the paper is to define the main drivers of residential energy use in Lithuania and to compare energy saving technologies in terms of energy saving potential and costs in Lithuanian residential buildings. Seeking to achieve the aim the main tasks of the paper are to analyse theoretical issues of the main drivers of residential energy use; to analyse residential energy use trends in Lithuania and to compare these trends with other EU member states; to define the main drivers of residential energy use by applying correlation analysis; to analyse policies aiming to reduce energy consumption in residential buildings and their impacts on GHG emission reduction. The comparative study of residential energy use in Lithuania and several old EU member states showed that residential energy use per capita in Lithuania is significantly lower than in old EU member states because of the lower income per capita and lower living standards. The economic and technological factors are the main driving forces of final energy consumption in all compared EU member states; however the impact of different factors varies between countries. The comparative analysis of energy saving and GHG emission reduction potential and costs in residential buildings provided by different studies showed that the most cost-effective instruments were appliance standards, energy efficiency obligations, Demand Side Management programs, public benefit charges and labelling.

      "China achieved an energy savings of 67.5 Mtce in the building sector at the end of the 11th Five-Year Plan and set a new target of 116 Mtce by the end of the 12th Five-Year Plan. In this paper, an improved bottom-up model is developed to assess the carbon abatement potential and marginal abatement cost (MAC) of 34 selected energy-saving technologies/measures for China's building sector. The total reduction potential is 499.8 million t-CO2 by 2030. 4.8 Gt-CO2 potential will be achieved cumulatively to 2030. By 2030, total primary energy consumption of Chinese building sector will rise continuously to 1343 Mtce in the reference scenario and 1114 Mtce in the carbon reduction scenario. Total carbon dioxide emission will rise to 2.39 Gt-CO2 and 1.9 Gt-CO2 in two scenarios separately. The average carbon abatement cost of the aforementioned technologies is 19.5 $/t-CO2. The analysis reveals that strengthening successfully energy-saving technologies is important, especially for the residential building sector. The central government's direct investments in such technologies should be reduced without imposing significant negative effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "A novel calculation tool (REMA) for assessing the effects of various energy efficiency measures in buildings on the scale of the whole building stock of Finland is presented along with an estimate concerning the most recent changes in the regulation for energy use in buildings. REMA is a bottom-up model that uses representative building types (archetypes) for estimating energy consumption in different segments of the building stock. Future developments are estimated using annual rates of new construction, renovations and removals from the building stock. REMA was used to calculate the development of energy use in the building stock after the latest changes to the Finnish building code. For this purpose, the energy demands of the different standard building types were simulated using the IDA-ICE 4.2 dynamic simulation program. The results show a decrease of about 3% in heating energy consumption to 70.0 TWh and a 6% increase in electricity consumption to 19.7 TWh by the year 2020 corresponding to a reduction of 2% in total energy consumption. For CO2 emissions, a decrease of about 4% can be expected by 2020 concerning all energy use in the building stock. Over longer periods of time, the pace of reductions is accelerated as the share of new buildings in the stock grows larger. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "This paper presents the historical development and background of life cycle assessment (LCA) and nearly zero-energy buildings in Germany. In order to plan and build responsibly for the future, it is necessary to have an overview of the topic at hand. Final energy demand during the operational phase of buildings has fallen steadily. According to European Union guidelines (2010/31/EU), starting in 2021 new buildings must achieve the nearly zero-energy standards. These buildings will have very low operational energy demand. As a consequence of this requirement, the relative impact of construction and disposal increases in terms of the entire life cycle. This is also the case currently for buildings with low operational energy demand. The research - based on a literature analysis and review - shows that LCA has existed since the 1970s as a tool to judge potential environmental impacts. Moreover, the energy building standards in Germany have developed continuously since 1977. This process will continue in the new German Energy Saving Ordinance in 2014, which will be tightened even further in 2016. As LCA is well established and sustainable buildings are becoming increasingly common, the next indispensable step is to consider the life cycle view of nearly zero-energy buildings.

      "According to the European Buildings Directive for the Energy Performance of Buildings 2010/31/EU [1] all new public buildings must correspond to the nearly zero energy standard from 2018 and all other new buildings from 2020. Furthermore, sustainable design and evaluation according to established certification systems such as the German Sustainable Building Certificate (DGNB), the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) or the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) is more and more requested by investors for buildings and entire neighbourhood developments. In order, to meet these requirements and to ensure a high quality of the building, project teams pursue a holistic life-cycle approach to optimize buildings and neighbourhoods. In order to support this optimization process, an Integrated Virtual Energy Laboratory (IVEL) was developed during the EU research project Holistic Energy Efficiency Simulation and Lifecycle Management Of Public Use Facilities (09/2010-12/2013 HESMOS) and will be further developed in the EU research project Collaborative Holistic Design Laboratory and Methodology for energy-efficient Embedded Buildings (eeEmbedded 10/2013-09/2017).\n",

      "The purification or incinerator gases produces large quantities of fly ash and used lime [a combination referred to as air pollution control residues (APCR)], both of which contain elevated levels of metals. This paper describes biological solubilization assays utilizing Thiobacillus ferrooxidans to leach metals from APCR to render them nonhazardous. The multistage solubilization process involves an alkaline aqueous phase that removes some Pb. In the second phase, the APCR are acidified to pH 4 with H2SO4, then inoculated with a bacterial culture that has been acclimated in the presence of 2% Fe (FeCl3). Several rinses and decantings achieve removal of the leachable metals. The final step involves the addition of Ca(H2PO4)(2) and an increase in the treatment pH prior to the final filtration. Viability of thiobacilli in APCR was poor. Despite this problem, the removal of Pb was 35.9%, 46.0%, and 68.7% (for APCR containing 1594, 3026, and 5038 mg Pb/kg, respectively), which demonstrates greater metal removal with increased APCR contamination. Zn removal varied from 68.2% (8273 mg Zn/kg APCR) to 79.5% (16,873 mg Zn/kg APCR), which was positively correlated to the level of residue contamination, whereas Cu was removed in the proportions of 26.9% (495 mg Cu/kg APCR) to 68.2% (465 mg Cu/kg APCR). Cadmium removal appeared to be independent of the level of Cd in the APCR; Cd was removed to the greatest degree, with a variation of 92.0% (129 mg Cd/kg APCR) to 94.7% (267 mg Cd/kg APCR). The treated APCR were tested using four different leachate tests. The APCR released 43 mg Pb/liter during contact with water, and 7.40 mg Cd/liter during TCLP [the toxicity characterization leaching procedure of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA)]. After biological treatment, the leachate from TCLP was within the acceptance criteria of the US EPA, if the pH of the APCR was increased to pH 5 after the biological treatment. In the case of the Transport Canada leaching test, a betterment of the process is required in order to satisfy the stringent regulatory level of 0.5 mg Cd/liter (0.68 and 0.57 mg/liter).\n",

      "The future for people lies increasingly in and around cities. Government actions within cities, including those assisted by aid efforts, have tended to concentrate on a few key services. Those services have been remarkably similar over time, consisting of public health services, public transport, sanitation, solid waste management and water supply. The provision of those services, and the needs for government intervention, has been historically justified on grounds of economic development, environmental sustainability or social equity. This article addresses the hypothesis that the core concerns of providing a better environment have changed little over 50 years (nor indeed since the great influenza epidemic that struck India and Britain in the late 1840s). The question it poses is whether those concerns will change much over the next 50 years. The magnitude will be greater; by 2050 it is likely that three out of four people will live in or near cities. Priorities, technologies and management methods appear to have undergone great changes. The language of urban or environmental management has also changed. How important have been those changes? How new are the current concerns with the new public management, private financing of public services, public-private partnerships, service inclusion and targeting the poor, or participatory development? The article highlights the need to view current means to manage the environments of essentially poor people in the context of the ends and purpose of such management. It reviews articles in PAD and other writings to examine the interplay between ends and means in the past. This may help predict likely future directions, not perhaps over the next 50, but possibly over the next 10 years. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n",

      "Oxford has already achieved much of what is advocated in the new Transport White Paper. A key component of this is the city's park-and-ride system, which is the largest and most long-standing in the country. Introduced in 1973 as part of a package of measures to restrain private vehicle traffic and encourage the use of public transport, cycling and walking, it now has a capacity of 3900 cars at four sites. One in five car trips originating outside the ring road and bound for central Oxford are diverted into park-and-ride car parks during the morning peak. The majority of users on weekdays are travelling to work. At weekends shopping is the predominant purpose. Frequent buses serve the sites, operating between 05.30 and 23.30 Monday-Saturday, and between 08.45 and 17.45 on Sundays, largely without subsidy. These bus services benefit from extensive bus priority arrangements. High city centre parking charges and strict parking controls support the use of park-and-ride. This paper describes how the system has been successful in stabilizing traffic levels within Oxford for over 25 years while the city has flourished. Now, Oxford is one of the least car-dependent cities in the country, and one of the few places where public transport patronage has increased rather than declined in recent years.\n",

      "Excessive energy consumption is one of the serious problems of large cities in Iran. In order to avoid unreasonable growth in energy use as well as conservation of natural resources, more attention should be paid to energy consumption patterns in metropolitan cities. Accordingly, the current study aims at analyzing energy demand and its related pollutants in the household sector in Tehran Metropolitan. The study includes a discussion of past trends and future scenarios to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in this sector. Using LEAP software and according to Iran's long-term development policies, energy demand and its greenhouse gas emissions were evaluated based on a baseline scenario within a long-term horizon (from 2011 to 2036). Energy demand was analyzed in the form of seven alternative scenarios. The obtained results indicated that natural gas consumption will increase to 21,084 MCM by the year 2036. In addition, the electricity consumption rate will grow to 21,084 million kWh over the studied period, if the current trend of consumption continues. The findings also revealed that maximum energy savings (equal to 23%) can be achieved by implementing Note 19 of National Building Regulations until 2036. Consequently, with implementation of this law, around 21.7% of total greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced in Tehran.\n",

      "Urban areas are recognised to be significant global energy consumers, and therefore high CO2 emitters, making energy management at urban scales a relevant research focus. However, one of the main obstacles faced with upgrading existing urban systems to meet target energy reductions is the current rate of refurbishment and new build, where it is estimated that 75% of existing buildings will still be in place by 2050. Moreover limited renewable resources and predicted warming trends place further limitations on policies aimed at carbon management. This paper examines current thinking around energy management associated with building operational and regulated loads and the role of urban form. Its focus is on cooling loads for office buildings in central London and offers a new perspective on energy management at an urban scale by demonstrating (within the 25% redevelopment rate) that when building energy management is considered within an urban context, the overall performance of an urban system can be significantly improved. The work highlights the often overlooked role of urban form on building energy performance (both individually and in combination) and demonstrates that as we move towards a low energy future; the role of urban form becomes increasing significant.

Malaysia Government has launched the Green Building Index in 2009 to support the sustainable approach to construction and protect natural environment. Applying the green features to achieve the GBI certification leads to higher construction cost for developers, consequently it will cause higher price for green buildings customers. The aims of this paper are to identify potential green house buyers' awareness of green homes, to determine the extra price that potential home buyers are willing to pay for green home, to explore favorable green features which potential home buyers are willing to pay extra for and to provide recommendation how many green features can be acceptable and affordable for potential green homebuyers. To collect data, a questionnaire survey was conducted by research team in different parts of Malaysia. 2180 questionnaires were distributed among the people selected randomly in the most important cities in Malaysia. A total 817 questionnaires (37.48%) have been received. The analysis method in this research is descriptive. SPSS software was used to analysis the primary data. This study finds out that public awareness about green homes' benefits is average and the majority of respondents are willing to pay less than 5% premium cost to buy green homes. In addition, the most favorable green features from green home buyers' point of view are indoor environment quality, energy efficiency and greenery. Therefore, they prefer to pay higher price for green homes which are facilitated with their preferred green features.\n",

      "This paper aims to investigate the effects of retrofitting existing public buildings in the \"Hot Summer Cold Winter\" climate region of China, using simulation and a case study, to see how retrofitted public buildings perform in the face of climate change in the region. This area of China is one of the most challenging regions for providing occupant comfort in buildings, with high demands for heating as well as cooling, together with high humidity levels. The simulation results suggest that energy reduction of up to 40% with improvements to the building enclosure is possible by retrofitting current existing public buildings to the new Chinese National Standard for the Zhejiang Province.Requirements for combating possible increase in energy consumption from heating and cooling demands due to future climate change was also investigated, and it was found that by simply improving U-Values of the building envelope to the new national standards set for the Zhejiang Province, the effects of future climate change can be nullified up to the 2080s. Further improvements to having similar standards as developed countries such as England and Wales will have less significance and cannot nullify the effects of climate change from the newly retrofitted public buildings. However, this can be achieved by involving other energy-saving strategies and installing suitable energy-saving technologies for the region. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

      "Domestic solar water heating systems are a cost effective and mature technology that enjoys increasing popularity around the world yet in many countries the penetration rates are still low. The recent growth in Lebanon's solar water heater market reflects tremendous efforts on the legislative, financial, and awareness level. This paper analyzes the developments in this market and highlights persisting barriers. Our scenario analysis presents a baseline scenario (BS) and two different renewable energy scenarios. RES-1 makes solar water heating systems mandatory for newly constructed dwellings while RES-2 requires also the use of solar water heating systems in already existing buildings. Results show that in the BS electricity consumption growth (for water heating purposes) reaches a record high of 2430 GWh in 2027 while this number is limited to 1550 GWh in the same year in RES-1. In RES-2 electricity consumption reaches only 1393 GWh in 2027. The penetration rate of domestic SWH systems in the BS, RES-1 and RES-2 reaches respectively 10%, 58% and 67% by 2027. Yearly savings in government subsidies reach 209 million USD in 2027 in case of RES-1 and 246 million USD in 2027 in RES-2. We also present avoided CO2 emissions in each scenario. Increasing electricity prices to cost recovery levels, a SWH capital cost subsidy of 18% in combination with a zero interest green loan can leave a consumer's electricity bill unchanged during the repayment period. Under subsidized electricity prices, a 70% capital cost subsidy would be necessary to achieve the same result. We recommend the implementation of legislation making the use of domestic solar water heating systems mandatory for both existing and newly constructed dwellings, the further development of subsidization programs and increasing electricity prices to cost recovery levels. Concomitantly these measures will foster economic development in a sustainable manner. (C) 2012 International Energy Initiative. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n",

This paper presents viable scenarios to achieve the achievement of nearly zero energy dwellings in the southern European country of Cyprus. The analysis is based on the documentation of the developments in the building sector after the adoption of mandatory building insulation regulations. For this purpose, data concerning the building stock of Cyprus before the adoption of the regulation of thermal insulation, as well as the construction characteristics for sixty dwellings which were built from 2010 to 2012 are compared. The ability of adoption of renewable energy in the building sector is also analyzed. Several scenarios are examined and a matrix defining the possible ranges of primary consumption of dwellings in Cyprus considered as nearly zero energy are presented. Possible scenarios examined in relation to consumption of dwellings in Cyprus by 2020 showed that this would range from 65 to 40 kWh/m(2) year, depending on the degree of renewable energy technologies penetration. The outcomes of this work are particularly revealing with regard to the definition of feasible consumption targets for nearly zero energy dwellings in southern Europe by 2020. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

      "This research develops then merges two separate models to simulate electric vehicle diffusion through recreation of the Boston metropolitan statistical area vehicle market place. The first model is a mixed (random parameters) logistic regression applied to data from the US Department of Transportation's 2009 National Household Travel Survey. The second, agent-based model simulates social network interactions through which agents' vehicle choice sets are endogenously determined. Parameters from the first model are applied to the choice sets determined in the second. Results indicate that electric vehicles as a percentages of vehicle stock range from 1% to 22% in the Boston metropolitan statistical area in the year 2030, percentages being highly dependent on scenario specifications. A lower price is the main source of competitive advantage for vehicles but other characteristics, such as vehicle classification and range, are demonstrated to influence consumer choice. Government financial incentive availability leads to greater market shares in the beginning years and helps to spread diffusion in later years due to an increased base of initial adopters. Although seen as a potential hindrance to EV diffusion, battery cost scenarios have relatively small impacts on EV diffusion in comparison to policy, range, miles per gallon (MPG), and vehicle miles travelled (VMT) as a percentage of range assumptions. Pessimistic range assumptions decrease overall PHEV and BEV percentages of vehicle stock by 50% and 30%, respectively, relative to the EPA-estimated range scenarios. Fuel cost scenarios do not considerably alter estimated BEV and PHEV stock but increase the ratio of car stock to light truck stock in the internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle spectrum. Specifically, cars are estimated at 55% of ICE vehicle stock in the default fuel price scenario but increase to 62% of ICE vehicle stock in the high world oil price scenario, with LTs covering the appropriate differences.\n",

One basic document of the Technical Building Code deals with the limitations of building energy demands. Nowadays, due to the recast of the European Directive on the energy performance of buildings (2010/31/EU, 2010), a revision process of the current regulations has begun, starting with the Technical Building Code, with its first revision envisaged for 2012. In this paper we, as collaborators in this updating process, describe and analyse the main changes regarding ventilation and infiltration that the \"new\" Technical Building Code (TBC) is going to introduce. These main changes cover: 1. The calculation methodology; 2. The ventilation technologies that can be considered; 3. The default values and the data that the user can supply to assess particular cases. Basically, these changes make it possible to move from a previous regulation that considered: 1. One indoor pressure and one outdoor pressure, assuming all the indoor spaces as a single-zone (calculation methodology EN 13465 (2004)); 2. A constant extraction flow for 24 hours a day, without the possibility of using a control system; 3. No possibilities of changing the sizing of vents, default behaviour curve of the vents and air permeability of opaque elements according to EN 13465 (2004). To a new regulation that considers: 1. One indoor pressure and one outdoor pressure (calculation methodology EN 15242 (2007)) but keeping indoor zoning that allows calculating (using mass conservation) the airflow between zones; 2. The possibility of using a control system allowing different flows each hour for a demand controlled ventilation scheme and pre-heating of supply air flow; 3. The possibility of sizing vents, using self-regulating vents and changing the air permeability of opaque elements, for example if a blower-door test has been carried out.\n",

These included the 'setsuden (energy saving)' campaigns, which promoted the minimum indoor temperature setting of 28 degrees C in summer. However, there is no scientific basis for this recommendation. Japan does not have adaptive comfort standards and the ASHRAE standard-55 does not include the data from the land of the rising sun. In this context, we conducted a thermal comfort field study in four office buildings in Tokyo for three months in summer 2012. We measured all the four environmental and the two personal variables. Through a paper based field survey, we interviewed 435 occupants who returned 2402 questionnaires. The occupants' comfort temperature was found to be 27.2 degrees C. Thermal acceptability was very high at 89% even when 26% of the environments were outside the three central categories of the thermal sensation scale. PMV always significantly overestimated the sensation owing to a wide range of adaptations by the subjects. The indoor air speeds were low, indicating a need for ceiling fans. In 50% of the environments the indoor temperature was more than the 28 degrees C limit. As the buildings were designed for AC mode, running them in NV mode posed challenges. This study calls for elaborate field studies in offices in Japan for the development of custom made adaptive comfort standards. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

The present study was conducted to investigate the level of public awareness, and the attitudes and knowledge regarding epilepsy in the Saudi population in Riyadh - capital city of Saudi Arabia. Methods: A survey consisting of 19 questions pertaining to epilepsy awareness was distributed to Saudi citizens living in Riyadh older than 15 years of age in malls, supermarkets, health clubs, mosques, universities and schools. Results: Of the 7078 respondents who completed the questionnaire, 6756 (95.5%) had heard about epilepsy, 3024 (42.7%) had witnessed what they believed to be a seizure and 5164 (73%) would allow their children to interact with an individual who had epilepsy. However, 5382 (76%) respondents would not want their children to marry an individual with epilepsy, 1004 (14.2%) believed that epilepsy was infectious and 574 (8.1%) believed that epilepsy was a type of mental illness. A total of 1509 (21.3%) respondents were not aware of a single potential cause of epilepsy, 3493 (50.6%) would not seek medical advice if one of their relatives had epilepsy, 2221 (31.4%) did not know how to deal with an individual experiencing an epileptic episode and 6554 (92.6%) did not know that surgery was a treatment option for individuals with epilepsy in Saudi Arabia.

      "US cities are beginning to experiment with a regulatory approach to address information failures in the real estate market by mandating the energy benchmarking of commercial buildings. Understanding how a commercial building uses energy has many benefits; for example, it helps building owners and tenants identify poor-performing buildings and subsystems and it enables high-performing buildings to achieve greater occupancy rates, rents, and property values. This paper estimates the possible impacts of a national energy benchmarking mandate through analysis chiefly utilizing the Georgia Tech version of the National Energy Modeling System (GT-NEMS). Correcting input discount rates results in a 4.0% reduction in projected energy consumption for seven major classes of equipment relative to the reference case forecast in 2020, rising to 8.7% in 2035. Thus, the official US energy forecasts appear to overestimate future energy consumption by underestimating investments in energy-efficient equipment. Further discount rate reductions spurred by benchmarking policies yield another 1.3-1.4% in energy savings in 2020, increasing to 2.2-2.4% in 2035. Benchmarking would increase the purchase of energy-efficient equipment, reducing energy bills, CO2 emissions, and conventional air pollution. Achieving comparable CO2 savings would require more than tripling existing US solar capacity. Our analysis suggests that nearly 90% of the energy saved by a national benchmarking policy would benefit metropolitan areas, and the policy's benefits would outweigh its costs, both to the private sector and society broadly.\n",

      "The building stock is one of the most important energy consumers worldwide. Therefore, a number of energy reduction targets and regulations exist for the construction sector. Different building stock models have been developed in order to investigate the potentials of energy-efficiency and changes in energy source in the building stock. However, these models often have important shortcomings, since they are single-issued and do not include the life cycle of buildings. Thus, we propose an innovative assessment methodology in the form of a life cycle-based building stock model (LC-Build). The building stock is clustered in building cohorts of similar construction and equipment characteristics in terms of type, construction period and building technology systems. The most important building components are assigned specific thermal transmittance values. Figures for diffusion and retrofit rate describe the development of the building stock fabric. Additionally, environmental impact from the energy supply side is taken into account. This approach facilitates the evaluation of the effectiveness of measures and their dynamics on the building stock, such as newer and more efficient technologies and practices related to energy policies and prices. Furthermore, the model has a direct relationship to the construction activity (energy-efficiency measures, substitution of fossil energy based heating systems) and fosters the comprehension of material flows, related environmental impact, and costs. The practicality of this approach is demonstrated by means of a case study in the city of Zurich in Switzerland. The results suggest that Zurich has a remarkable potential to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector: 85% by 2050. The case study highlights the advantages of the proposed modeling approach. The LC-Build is a valuable tool to identify and test sustainable energy targets for building stocks, such as the European 20-20-20 target. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Method for simplified calculation of controlled natural ventilation. As the building envelopes of energy efficient buildings are becoming increasingly air-tight, ventilation concepts are increasing in importance in order to ensure good quality room air and reliably prevent dampness. DIN 1946-6 contains requirements for producing ventilation concepts in housing - for the first time also in order to prevent dampness - which are satisfied by fan-assisted or free ventilation through external openings. An important prerequisite for these ventilation concepts is that they have to be functionally independent of user interaction. For buildings other than housing, DIN EN 13779 contains requirements for ventilation systems regarding the volume of air flow in order to achieve a healthy indoor climate. Furthermore, DIN EN 15251 contains criteria for the thermal interior climate of naturally ventilated buildings. Controlled natural ventilation through controllable window elements makes it possible to maintain adequate room air quality and humidity; in addition, this type of ventilation is interesting from the point of view of saving energy and increasing comfort levels as part of summer ventilation, and building cooling without energy consumption. However, the possibilities of controlled natural ventilation via automatically controlled windows are currently rarely explored in the design of ventilation systems for buildings, because the calculation of air quantity is complex due to continually changing boundary conditions, and simplified methods have not yet been adequately defined in the standards. This study covers the analysis of calculation methods which support the design of ventilation systems based on controlled natural ventilation and which could be adopted in the current standards. By producing robust proof with respect to the functionality of the chosen natural ventilation (in order to improve room air hygiene and prevent dampness), designers and building owners will find it easier to use natural ventilation.\n",

      "In February 1999, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) finished development of a comprehensive policy for reducing mercury contamination in the fish in Minnesota lakes. The MPCA's Mercury Contamination Reduction Initiative Advisory Council developed a mercury emissions inventory of sources in Minnesota, and recommended a time table for reductions, options and strategies for controlling, reducing, or eliminating mercury. Minnesota greatly reduced mercury emissions from waste combustors by regulating disposal of mercury-containing products, banning the sale of mercury-containing batteries, and imposing strict mercury emission limits for waste combustors. To determine whether efforts to reduce or eliminate mercury in products results in environmental benefits, MPCA characterized the fate of mercury in products, tracking its presence in various waste streams and estimated the quantity of mercury accidentally released to the air, land and water. For every 100 pounds of mercury properly disposed of or not used, 15 pounds of mercury per year is not released to the air. Overall reductions in mercury emissions and consequently, mercury deposition, are estimated to result in reducing the number of less restrictive fish consumption advisories by over 70%. The cost-effectiveness of various control techniques has been estimated for all sources of mercury air emissions in Minnesota. The lowest cost options (less than US$2500 per pound of mercury reduced) are products-related control options. Carbon injection at municipal waste combustors is estimated to cost US$5000 to US$7000 per pound of mercury reduced. Controlling mercury from utilities burning coal range from US$10,000 to US$300,000 per pound of mercury reduced. Data collected suggest that mercury in products, expressed through emissions from waste combustors, sludge incinerators, and backyard burning is still a significant and controllable source of mercury emissions, and appears to be cost-effective. Further research into controls at energy producers and taconite facilities needs to be done in order to address these sources, in order to achieve the 70%-mercury reduction goal (from 1990 levels) recommended by the Advisory Council.

Its magnetically levitated technology is extremely environmentally friendly, highly economical and comfortable and is to provide a very high degree of safety. Close links with the railway system, i.e. ICE and IC trains, as well as coordination with road and air traffic systems are to substantially improve the medium and long-range traffic offer. The Transrapid has proved its maturity on the Emsland test track, me planned construction of a high-speed monorail route connecting Berlin and Hamburg has meanwhile been cancelled by political decision. New options, e.g. for fast connections between other metropolitan areas or as regional train, are currently reviewed. The Transrapid guideway is considered a landmark example for the innovative use of steel. Unalloyed engineering steels and rebars are used for the construction of the different types of track supporting beams. The drive elements made of magnetic sheet steel are mounted on the tracks. It had been calculated that about 1 million t of steels a would be needed for the Berlin-Hamburg line and that 3400 t steel would be used per km of Transrapid track. The article presents the potential of steel for this future-oriented traffic system on the basis of the current planning state of the Berlin-Hamburg route.\n",

      "Recent economic expansion and population growth in developing countries have had a big impact on the development of large cities like Delhi, India. Accompanied by Delhi's rapid spatial growth over the last 25 years, urban sprawl has contributed to increased travel. The vehicle fleet projected at current growth rates will result in more than 13 million vehicles in Delhi in 2020. Planning and managing such a rapidly growing transport sector will be a challenge. Choices made now will have effects lasting well into the middle of the century: With such rapid transport growth rates, automobile emissions have become the fastest increasing source of urban air pollution. In India, most urban areas, including Delhi; already have major air pollution problems that could be greatly exacerbated if growth of the transport sector is managed unwisely. The transport plans designed to meet such large increases in travel demand will have to emphasize the movement of people, not vehicles, for a sustainable transportation system. Therefore, a mathematical model was developed to estimate the optimal transportation mix to meet this projected passenger-km demand while satisfying environmental goals, reducing congestion levels, and improving system and fuel efficiencies by exploiting a variety of policy options at the minimum overall cost or maximum welfare from transport. The results suggest that buses will continue to satisfy most passenger transport in the coming decades, so planning done in accordance with improving bus operations is crucial.\n",

      "Passive buildings compared to the standard ones require significantly less energy for heating, so the correct models of every \"energy using\" building's components are very important. This paper analyzes how various models of the internal heat and moisture gains, as well as natural airflows between building zones, influence the accuracy of the calculation of the energy performance, indoor temperatures and absolute humidity in a single-family passive building. A simulation environment used a detailed twelve-zone TRNSYS model of a house with HVAC system. The model included natural airflows between zones, and internal heat and moisture gains, defined as precisely as possible. The gains were allocated on the basis of special protocols of use filled by the occupants during the two-week measurement. The measurement data were also used for validation of the model. The verified model constituted a basis for calculation of energy performance and simulation of air temperature and absolute humidity change in a building with significantly limited airflow between zones, and heat and moisture gains defined according to standards. The standardized values of heat and moisture gains were defined on the basis of the standard ISO 13790 and national regulations in Poland. The simulations have shown that precise methodology of calculation of heat gains and airflows between building zones is very important for proper computation of energy performance and simulation of indoor temperatures and absolute humidity in passive buildings. Results of carried out analysis have shown that the difference in energy need for heating calculated using precise and simplified methods of internal heat gains determination was 30.1%.

      "Directive 2010/31/EU adopted that by the end of 2020 all new buildings should be nearly Zero-Energy Buildings (nZEB) and Member States should achieve cost-optimal levels by ensuring minimum energy performance requirements for buildings. This paper discusses how low should be the energy required by a nZEB, in the context of housing energy consumption in a Mediterranean climate (Lisbon). For selected houses built after 1990, the calculated primary energy loads for regulated uses - heating, cooling and domestic hot water - are found to be below 90 kWh/(m(2) year). Applying the cost-optimal solutions of thermal insulation and glazing type and considering energy efficiency improved systems, this study concludes that housing energy loads are 'low' for the indicative range of 70 kWh/(m(2) year) for regulated uses or 100-110 kWh/(m(2) year) for total uses, taking primary energy indicators (PEI) from EN 15603. Assuming PEI from Passive House Planning Package or those to be assumed in Portugal for 2013, the threshold decreases to 60 kWh/(m(2) year) for regulated uses or 90-100 kWh/(m(2) year) for total uses. Only the first nZEB condition is explored by this paper. The second condition requires that the nZEB energy load is covered by a 'significant' part of renewable energy sources produced on-site or 'nearby'. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "The simulation codes are diffusing widely in building design and energy performance evaluation. They also allow to refine the steady-state methods, particularly the estimations of the utilization factors, according to the technical standard EN ISO 13790:2008. The necessary validation steps used for diagnostic purposes are not aimed to evaluate the agreement of the results over the spectrum of configurations and conditions in real applications. Moreover, the relative impact of a single parameter on the global performance can be investigated only with an appropriate choice of the set of configurations analyzed. In this work, a method to evaluate the relative inaccuracy arising from the choice of a specific simulation code has been applied to compare two well-known dynamic simulation software applications: TRNSYS 16.1 and EnergyPlus 7. The main envelope variables investigated are dispersing surface amount, wall insulation and heat capacity, glazings insulation and solar transmittance, glazing dimensions and orientation, and internal gains. More than 1600 configurations were obtained through a full factorial plan for two Italian climatic conditions. Monthly heating and cooling needs, heating and cooling peak loads, and peaks occurrence time have been considered. Inferential statistics allowed weighting of the different variables impact on the found deviations.\n",

      "Residential buildings account for about one-third of the final energy demand in Norway. Many cost-effective measures for reducing heat losses in buildings are known, and their implementation may make the building sector one of the largest contributors to climate change mitigation. To determine the sectoral emission reduction potential, we model a complete transformation of the dwelling stock by 2050 by applying both renovation and reconstruction with different energy standards. We propose a new dynamic stock model with an optimization routine to identify and prioritize buildings with the highest energy saving potential. We combine material flow analysis (MFA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques to extend the sectoral boundary beyond direct household emissions. Despite an expected population growth of almost 50% between 2000 and 2050, sectoral carbon emissions in that period may drop between 30% and 40% for scenarios where the stock is completely transformed by either reconstruction or renovation to the passive house standard. Due to its lower upstream impact, renovation leads to a lower sectoral carbon footprint than reconstruction. Full transformation, however, is not sufficient to achieve an emissions reduction of 50% or more, as required on average to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, because hot water generation, appliances, and lighting will dominate the sectoral footprint once the stock has been transformed. A first estimate of the additional impact of realistic energy efficiency and lifestyle changes in the nonheating part of the sector reveals a maximal total reduction potential of about 75%.\n",

      "This paper examines the willingness of urban households in Ghana to accept economic incentives to participate in solid waste source separation. Low income households were less inclined to accept cash incentives than middle or high income households indicating that other factors than purely costs for waste management are important for households to participate in source-separation of waste. Perceptions on health and sorting and the availability of open space in the households were important for the willingness to accept incentives for source separation. The empirical findings indicate that household-level solid waste separation is positively influenced by gender (female) and sorting or health-related perceptions on source separation. About 80% of the households are willing to accept cash incentive of GF cent 1.6374 (US$1.6347) per month to participate in source separation, and the mean cash incentive per month is GH cent 1.2186 (US$1.2166).

      "Objective. To determine why people do or do not wear helmets while bicycling. Methods. A survey was conducted from August through October 1999. Two survey areas were chosen for this study: local public schools and paved bicycle trails. For the school arm of the study, 3 public elementary, middle, and high schools were selected from 3 different regions of Rochester, Minnesota, for participation in the study. For the bicycle arm of the study, 3 paved trails located in southeastern Minnesota were selected. A total of 2970 surveys were distributed to the public school system, and 463 surveys were collected from bicyclists on the paved bicycle trails. The survey population was split into 3 age categories for analysis: child (7-10), adolescent (11-19), and adult (older than 19). Results. Of the 2970 surveys distributed to Rochester public schools, 2039 (69%) were returned for analysis. Seventy-eight of the surveys that were completed in the public school system were discarded for the following reasons: age <10 years (35), insufficient completion (24), and selection of every reason for not wearing a bicycle helmet (19). A total of 463 surveys were completed on the 3 paved bicycle trails. One survey from the paved bicycle trail arm of the study was discarded because of insufficient completion. The total number of surveys used for statistical analysis was 2424. The distribution of male (52.7%) and female (47.3%) participants was similar. No significant difference in bicycle helmet use was found between genders. The age groups with the highest rate of bicycle helmet use were 50 to 59 years (62%) and older than 59 years (70%). The age groups with the lowest rate of bicycle helmet use were 11 to 19 years (31%) and 30 to 39 years (30%). The most common reasons given for not wearing a bicycle helmet were \"uncomfortable,\" \"annoying,\" \"it's hot,\" \"don't need it,\" and \"don't own one.\" Bicycle helmet use was significantly influenced by peer helmet use in all 3 age groups. Children also were more likely to wear a bicycle helmet when their parents wore bicycle helmets. A majority of respondents in all 3 age groups indicated that bicycle helmets provided either \"moderate\" or \"great\" protection from head injury, although significantly more adults (65.9%) than adolescents (43.9%) believed that the protection afforded by bicycle helmets was \"great.\" Despite this belief, a majority of adolescents and adults indicated that there was only a \"slight risk\" of head injury when bicycling without a helmet. Participants in all 3 categories were more likely to wear a bicycle helmet when they indicated either that there was a \"great risk\" of head injury when bicycling without a helmet or that helmets provided \"great protection\" from head injury. Adolescents and adults who believed that bicycling without a helmet put one at \"great risk\" for head injury also were more likely to indicate that helmets provided \"great protection\" from head injury. Conclusions. The prevalence of bicycle helmet use remains low despite research indicating the high level of head injury risk when bicycling without a helmet and the significant protection afforded by bicycle helmets. With the information provided by this survey, a well-designed intervention to increase the use of bicycle helmets can be implemented. Suggestions for a campaign to promote an increase in bicycle helmet use include focusing efforts on males and females between 11 and 19 years and 30 and 39 years of age; educating the public on new bicycle helmet designs that address comfort, ventilation, and fashion; educating adolescents on the significant protection from head injury afforded by bicycle helmets; and educating the public on the risk and severity of head injury associated with bicycling without a helmet. The influence of parents and peers on bicycle helmet use may be targeted through education and statements such as, \"If you wear a bicycle helmet, you are not only protecting yourself, you are also helping to protect your friends and/or children\".\n",

      "The twentieth century saw a dramatic increase in the production of urban solid waste, reflecting unprecedented global levels of economic activity. Despite some efforts to reduce and recover the waste, disposal in landfills is still the most usual destination. However, landfill has become more difficult to implement because of its increasing cost, community opposition to landfill siting, and more restrictive environmental regulations regarding the siting and operation of landfills. Moreover, disposal in landfill is the waste destination method with the largest demand for land, while land is a resource whose availability has been decreasing in urban systems. Shortage of land for landfills is a problem frequently cited in the literature as a physical constraint. Nonetheless, the shortage of land for waste disposal has not been fully studied and, in particular, quantified. This paper presents a method to quantify the relationship between the demand and supply of suitable land for waste disposal over time using a geographic information system and modelling techniques. Based on projections of population growth, urban sprawl and waste generation the method can allow policy and decision-makers to measure the dimension of the problem of shortage of land into the future. The procedure can provide information to guide the design and schedule of programs to reduce and recover waste, and can potentially lead to a better use of the land resource. Porto Alegre City, Brazil was used as the case study to illustrate and analyse the approach. By testing different waste management scenarios, the results indicated that the demand for land for waste disposal overcomes the supply of suitable land for this use in the study area before the year 2050.

Setting: 239 electoral wards in 57 local authorities in England and Wales. Participants: 617 elected local politicians. Interventions: Intervention group politicians were provided with tailored information packs, including maps of casualty sites, numbers injured and a synopsis of effective interventions. Main outcome measures: 25-30 months post intervention, primary outcomes included: electoral ward level: percentage of road traffic calmed; proportion with new interventions; school level: percentage with 20 mph zones, Safe Routes to School, pedestrian training or road safety education; politician level: percentage lobbying for safety measures. Secondary outcomes included politicians' interest and involvement in injury prevention, and facilitators and barriers to implementation. Results: Primary outcomes did not significantly differ: % difference in traffic calming (0.07, 95% CI: -0.07 to 0.20); proportion of schools with 20 mph zones (RR 1.47, 95% CI: 0.93 to 2.32), Safe Routes to School (RR 1.34, 95% CI: 0.83 to 2.17), pedestrian training (RR 1.23, 95% CI: 0.95 to 1.61) or other safety education (RR 1.16, 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.39). Intervention group politicians reported greater interest in child injury prevention (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.16), belief in potential to help prevent injuries (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.61), particularly pedestrian safety (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.03). 63% of intervention politicians reported supporting new pedestrian safety schemes. The majority found the advocacy information surprising, interesting, effectively presented, and could identify suitable local interventions. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of an innovative approach to translational public health by targeting local politicians in a randomised controlled trial. The intervention package was positively viewed and raised interest but changes in interventions were not statistically significance. Longer term supported advocacy may be needed.

      "The construction industry is the major solid waste generator in Hong Kong. In 1998, it generated about 32710 t per day of construction and demolition (C&D) waste. In the management of such a huge quantity of C&D waste, Hong Kong has adopted a strategy of depositing the inert portion (e.g, sand, bricks and concrete) of the waste at public filling areas for land reclamation and the non-inert portion (e.g. plastics, paper, wood) at municipal solid waste landfills. However, the C&D waste arisen is usually in the form of a mixture of both inert and non-inert materials. As a result, the waste has to be disposed of at landfills, aggravating the landfill shortage problem. There is a paramount need to separate the C&D waste into its constituent parts before it is delivered to either the landfills or the public filling areas for disposal. In order to study the feasibility of carrying out on-site waste sorting and the current situation of the building relating C&D waste generated in Hong Kong, a survey was conducted. This paper presents the results of the survey undertaken to evaluate three alternative waste sorting methods on building construction sites and to compare them with the use of an off-site central waste sorting facility. The results indicate source separation has the advantages of requiring less effort and resulting in better segregation of inert and non-inert wastes as compared with waste sorting centrally carried out at a designated area on- or off-site. In addition, the views of the building industry participants were also obtained through a questionnaire survey to give a better understanding of their attitude on on-site waste sorting. The results indicate that the building construction participants are reluctant to carry out on-site waste sorting. Even when high a tipping fee is imposed, they have little incentive to perform on-site waste sorting which is considered to be time and labour demanding. Only through contractual requirements or legislation can on-site waste sorting be fully implemented and becomes a long-term solution to the landfill shortage problem in Hong Kong.

      "This paper estimates and analyzes the historical and future trends of energy demand and environmental emissions from passenger transportation of the Kathmandu Valley covering CO2, CO, HC, NOx, SO2, total suspended particles (TSP) and lead (Pb). It uses the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System framework for constructing future scenarios up to year 2020 and analyzing their implications; these scenarios mainly deal with the traffic improvement measures, promotion of public transportation and electric vehicles. The results estimate over a four-fold increase in energy demand in 1988-2000. TSP increase of 4.5 times in this period is the major concern since high particulate concentration is already above World Health Organization guidelines. Under the non-intervention scenario, energy demand in 2020 is estimated to be 2.7 times that in the year 2000. Similarly, 2.5 times increase of TSP in 2020 from the year 2000 is estimated that would further increase the TSP concentrations. The scenario analyses suggest that increasing vehicle speed, promoting public transportation and promoting electric vehicles could reduce energy demand by 28%, 28% and 18%, respectively, while promoting a reasonably comfortable condition on overcrowded public transportation could increase energy demand by 10% from non-intervention scenario. For TSP, any future measures would not be enough unless the attention is not paid to in-use vehicle stock. A mix of all the policies mentioned above has potentials to cut down CO2 emissions to over 60% from the non-intervention case in 2020. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

The regulations do not make cost-effectiveness a primary criteria for choosing measures but cost remains important to a variety of stakeholders.This communication summarizes results from GHG and cost analysis for seven actual San Diego County road transportation policies: telecommute, vanpools, a bicycle strategy, an increase in mass transit use, parking policies (parking pricing, preferred parking for electric vehicles), an increased local fuel tax and speed harmonization (signal re-timing, roundabouts). Net costs are calculated as the sum of direct costs and benefits to the administering agency, the employer and the individual. Net costs per metric ton GHG abated vary greatly across measures, from negative to high positive (more than US $1000). We find that local GHG cost cannot be sensibly compared to other carbon or GHG policy costs outside the local context for a variety of reasons, but especially because measures have not been adopted primarily for carbon or GHG abatement potential or on the basis of cost effectiveness.

Several initiatives were taken to reduce extremely high levels of pollutants present in the ambient air of urban city. One of the initiatives was to move public transport to CNG, which has been implemented in Delhi since April 2001. Delhi boasted CNG in nearly 2200 buses, 25,000 three wheelers, 6000 taxis and 10,000 cars. However, more than half of the vehicles are yet to be changed to CNG. A relative comparison of ambient air concentration of pollutants, e.g. carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), suspended particulate matter (SPM) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx), emitted from transport sector, during the years 1995-2000 (without CNG) and the year 2001 (with CNG) has been made in order to assess the impact of CNG vehicles on ambient air quality in Delhi. It has been found that concentration contribution of above pollutants has been reduced considerably. The annual average concentration of SPM came down to 347 from 405 mug m(-3), which is still beyond the permissible limits. The concentration of annual averages of CO, SO2 and NOX decreased to 4197 from 4681 mug m(-3), 14 from 18 mug m(-3) and 34 from 36 mug m(-3), respectively, and are well within the permissible limits. An analysis Of SO2/NOx and CO/NOX concentrations, whose correlation coefficient r(2) has the values 0.7613 and 0.7903, respectively, indicates that point sources are contributing to SO2 and mobile sources are contributing to NOX concentrations.

      "The UK housing stock will play an important role in achieving the 2050 national carbon reduction targets. Upgrading the energy performance of the existing housing stock is a significant challenge because retrofit activities are shaped by a wide range of fragmented policies, programmes and actors. Existing approaches to housing retrofit focus on regulations, financial incentives and information provision, but it is argued these are insufficient to realize large-scale, deep changes in energy consumption. An agenda is proposed for systemic domestic retrofit to realize radical changes in the housing stock through community-based partnerships. These programmes are based on a social practices approach that promotes social innovation. Wide-ranging energy-efficiency upgrades can be achieved through the development and realization of customized solutions to local groups of houses through facilitated engagement between occupants, housing providers, community groups, local authorities and construction professionals. Community-based domestic retrofit programmes serve to reframe the governance of household energy performance and suggest alternative routes for realizing significant reductions in energy demand through changes in the socio-technical configuration of materials, competences and images of domestic energy practices.\n",

The study was conducted in East York, a health district of Metropolitan Toronto, in collaboration with the East York Health Unit. In 1996, the total population was 107 822, 11 340 of which were children 5 to 14 years. Census data were used to group the 21 census tracts in East York into 7 geographically distinct areas. The boundaries of these areas are natural barriers to travel, such as expressways, ravines, railway tracks, and hydroelectric power lines. The areas were also ranked according to average family income ( based on Statistics Canada data). For analytical purposes, areas were defined as low-, mid-, and high-income areas. Census data profiles of the areas have been previously described. For each consecutive year from 1990 to 1997 inclusive, direct observations of children riding bicycles in East York during the months of April through October were made. In 1995, observations were completed before the introduction of the law on October 1, 1995. Only children who were between 5 and 14 years of age and riding a 2-wheeled bicycle were included in the study. In total, 111 sites across all 7 areas were selected for observation. Observational sites included school yards of all elementary and middle schools ( kindergarten to grade 8) and all parks in East York. In addition, 5 major intersections and 5 residential streets from each area were randomly selected. Observers were trained and used a standardized data collection form. A pilot study showed that the data collected by observers were reliable and valid. Observers remained at each site for 1 hour and collected data on helmet use and sex. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Hospital for Sick Children Research Ethics Board, the East York Board of Education, and the Metropolitan Separate School Board. The proportion of children who were wearing a bicycle helmet was estimated by year ( 1990 - 1997, inclusive), sex ( male, female), location ( school, park, major intersection, residential street), and income area ( low, mid, high). For estimating the effect of legislation on helmet use, data from the year immediately after legislation ( 1996) were compared with data from the year preceding legislation ( 1995). The relative risk (RR) of helmet use ( after vs before legislation) was calculated along with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for potential confounding variables ( sex and location). Results. During the 8-year study period, 9768 observations were made ( range: 914-1879 observations per year). The proportion of child cyclists who wore a bicycle helmet increased steadily during the first 4 years of the study period, from 4% in 1990 ( 34 of 914), to 16% in 1991 ( 303 of 1879), to 25% in 1992 ( 383 of 1563), and to 45% in 1993 ( 438 of 984). During 1994 ( 460 of 1083) and 1995 ( 568 of 1227), helmet use remained relatively stable at approximately 44%. Helmet use rose markedly in 1996 ( the first year after helmet legislation was introduced) to 68% ( 818 of 1202) and remained stable at 66% ( 609 of 916) in 1997. Throughout the study period, girls were consistently more likely to wear helmets than were boys. In total, 47% ( 1420 of 3047) of girls wore helmets, compared with 33% ( 2193 of 6721) of boys ( RR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.36 - 1.50). In addition, children who were riding to school were more likely to use helmets, compared with children who were riding on residential streets, major intersections, and parks. Overall, 48% ( 1497 of 3129) of children who were riding to school wore bicycle helmets, compared with 32% ( 2116 of 6639) of children who were riding at other locations ( RR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.43 - 1.58). Children in the high-income areas were consistently more likely to wear helmets, compared with children in the mid-and low-income areas. Helmet legislation was associated with a significant increase in helmet use by children in East York. In 1995, 46% ( 568 of 1227) of children wore bicycle helmets, compared with 68% ( 818 of 1202) of children in 1996 ( RR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.37 - 1.58). The effect of legislation, however, varied by income area. In low-income areas, helmet use increased by 28% after legislation, from 33% ( 213 of 646) in 1995 to 61% ( 442 of 721) in 1996 ( RR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.64 - 2.11). In mid-income areas, helmet use increased by 29% after legislation, from 50% ( 150 of 300) in 1995 to 79% ( 185 of 234) in 1996 ( RR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.39 - 1.80). In high-income areas, helmet use increased by only 4%, from 73% ( 205 of 281) in 1995 to 77% ( 191 of 247) in 1996 ( RR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.96 - 1.17). This finding of a significant increase in helmet use after legislation in low- and mid-income areas but not in high-income areas remained even after logistic regression analysis adjusted for sex and location. Conclusions. This study showed that bicycle helmet use by children increased significantly after helmet legislation. In this urban area with socioeconomic diversity and in the context of prelegislation promotion and educational activities, the legislative effect was most powerful among children who resided in low- income areas.\n",

      "Transportation-related air pollution is one of the major problems facing many megacities in developing as well as developed countries. The design of air quality strategies for the road-based public transportation system in the Mexico City metropolitan area (MCMA) is considered. An analysis is done of 28 different emission reduction strategies consisting of bundles of technological and supply and demand management emission reduction policies across alternative future development scenarios of the MCMA in the 2000-2025 period. The analysis combines demand modeling, fleet evolution modeling, mobile-source emissions modeling, and trade-off analysis to evaluate the impact of these emission reduction strategies and to determine their cost-effectiveness. The combined use of scenario analysis and multiattribute trade-off analysis is a unique approach that allows the design of strategies that are robust across a range of future uncertainties. Results of the analysis show that combinations of aggressive technological and supply and demand management strategies are needed to achieve sustained emission reductions in the 2000-2025 period. The recommendation calls for combinations of strategies that rely on aggressive hybrid vehicle introductions, catalyst and particulate matter and nitrogen oxide filter retrofitting, dedicated busways, public transportation fare integration, and subsidies and fuel taxes. These combined strategies can reduce transportation emissions by more than 85%. Results also indicate that even the most aggressive strategies fail to achieve sustained emission reductions in the case of urban sprawl and the rapid growth in transportation demand.\n",

      "The anticipation of a large penetration of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) into the market brings up many technical problems that need to be addressed. In the near future, a large number of PHEVs in our society will add a large-scale energy load to our power grids, as well as add substantial energy resources that can be utilized. An emerging issue is that a large number of PHEVs simultaneously connected to the grid may pose a huge threat to the overall power system quality and stability. In this paper, the authors propose an algorithm for optimally managing a large number of PHEVs (e.g., 3000) charging at a municipal parking station. The authors used the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to intelligently allocate electrical energy to the PHEVs connected to the grid. A mathematical framework for the objective function (i.e., maximizing the average state-of-charge at the next time step) is also given. The authors considered real-world constraints such as energy price, remaining battery capacity, and remaining charging time. The authors also simulated the real-world parking deck scenarios according to the statistical analysis based on the transportation data. The authors characterized the performance of EDA using a Matlab simulation, and compared it with other optimization techniques.\n",

      "Energy consumption has emerged as one of the most important factors to be considered in the design of new buildings, as well as in building retrofitting. Several software resources are available to estimate building energy consumption during a whole year, including different standards for building energy certification. However, adhering to one of the main objectives of Annex 55 of the International Energy Agency, only a few methods are available to identify the best possible improvements to reduce energy consumption in existing or new buildings. This paper presents a new tool to define the best option to reduce building energy consumption. In this context, ISO standard 13790 calculation procedure was developed based on the Monte Carlo method and the results showed the probability of energy consumption as a Weibull model. Furthermore, a map of different Weibull models in line with different input parameters was developed as a design guide for the future. However, it was found that thermal inertia should only be considered in instantaneous energetic analysis and not in a yearly study and that the effect of the number of occupants on energy consumption could be obtained only for the heating season and not during the cooling season. This was not possible because it altered the normal distribution of building energy consumption. In short, a new tool had to be developed to define the probability of energy consumption of the different input parameters when designing a building with energy saving strategies.\n",

      "This article examines the inefficient use of resources in the Brazilian transportation system. The energy use growth and external cost generation in this essential economic sector are considerable, and the trend is towards an increasing problem in the coming years. The continued expansion of Brazilian cities and the increase in demand for mobility is a result of a substantial growth in the number of road transport users, as increased earnings enable lower income groups to acquire and use individual motorized means of transport. The aim of this paper is to estimate the potential gains from reducing individual motorized transport by the year 2020. This investigation concludes that in a conservationist scenario, by prioritizing low cost, low technology public policies-which include operation of Bus Rapid Transit systems, walking and cycling facilities and congestion charges, among others-it should be possible to save over USD 30 billion and USD 26 billion in external transportation and infrastructure costs, respectively, up to 2020. In addition, these public policies can save more than 35 million Tons of Oil Equivalents in energy consumption and avoid almost 4,000 thousand tons of local pollution emissions and 37,500 thousand tons of GHG emissions in the same period.\n",

The process of upgrading the existing building stock can be supported by land management tools, i.e., municipal energy plans (MEP) or sustainable building codes (BC), that municipalities use to plan, check and monitor actions taken. Many local and regional authorities are involved in the Covenant of Mayors supported by the European Union (EU): the sustainable energy action plan (SEAP) is the key document in which the Covenant signatory outlines how it intends to reach CO2 reduction target by 2020. Sustainability at the urban scale is also supported by voluntary certification schemes such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)(R) for neighbourhood development proposed by the United States Green Building Council (USGBC), Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) Communities proposed by UK Building Research Establishment (BRE) and Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency (CASBEE) for Urban Development proposed by the Japan GreenBuild Council. The fact that there are so many tools to manage urban sustainability is positive, but what happens when multiple tools are applied to the same territory? Overlap, redundancy, and conflicts in management may be critical elements. The purpose of this article is to analyze these critical issues, highlighting the elements of integration and possible synergies for effective management of sustainability at the local level.\n",

      "Subtropical south-east Queensland's expanding population is expected to lead to a demand for an additional 754,000 dwellings by 2031. A legacy of poor housing design, minimal building regulations, an absence of building performance evaluation and various social and market factors has lead to a high and growing penetration of, and reliance on, air-conditioners to provide comfort in this relatively benign climate. This reliance impacts on policy goals to adapt to and mitigate against global warming, electricity infrastructure investment and household resilience. Based on the concept of bioclimatic design, this field study scrutinizes eight non-air conditioned homes to develop a deeper understanding of the role of contemporary passive solar architecture in the delivery of thermally comfortable and resilient homes in the subtropics. These homes were found to provide inhabitants with an acceptable level of thermal comfort (18-28 degrees C) for 77-97% of the year. Family expectations and experiences of comfort, and the various design strategies utilized were compared against the measured performance outcomes. This comparison revealed issues that limited quantification and implementation of design intent and highlighted factors that constrained system optimisation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

      "This paper presents an analysis aimed to evaluate the feasibility of micro-CHP systems to meet the household energy demands of single family users. The considered CHP systems, with an electric power output of a few kW, are based on technologies (internal combustion engines, micro gas turbines, micro Rankine cycles, Stirling engines and thermophotovoltaic generators) which are already available on the market or will be available in the near future. Each CHP system is composed of (i) a prime mover, (ii) a thermal energy storage unit and (iii) an auxiliary boiler used to cover peak thermal demands. The analyses performed in this paper aim to evaluate (i) the energy performance of the CHP systems to meet the energy demand of two single-family dwellings, with different floor areas and shape factors, and (ii) the maximum cost allowed for each CHP system. The results presented in this paper allow the most suitable technology, prime mover and thermal energy storage unit size to be identified. From an energy point of view, the considered CHP systems usually satisfy most of the thermal and electric energy demand, with a primary energy saving index that is always higher than 20%. Moreover, the correct sizing of the thermal energy storage unit capacity proves crucial. As regards economic feasibility, it is shown that a reasonable target for the marginal cost of a CHP system for household heating is approximately 3000 epsilon/kW(e), even though the absence of incentives does not make any of the technologies very attractive at present. It is also shown that the highest profitability can be obtained by using the prime mover (i) with the lowest electric power output closest to that of the peak electric demand and (ii) with an electric-to-thermal ratio which fits the electric-to-thermal ratio of the users.

      "In this study the barriers to energy savings and the policy measures set up to overcome these barriers were mapped by interviewing stakeholders in ten European Union member states (MS). In addition, an estimate of energy savings potential was calculated. It seems that in most countries cost-effective energy savings of about 10% can be achieved by 2020 and 20% by 2030. A total annual energy saving of approx. 150 TWh by 2020 and approx. 280 TWh by 2030 appears possible. This can be compared to the total annual primary energy consumption of 21,000 TWh in all EU countries combined. Barriers and policies to overcome them were also studied. This was based on a literature review, stakeholder interviews and in-depth homeowner interviews in ten MS. A commonly cited problem was that people are not keen to improve energy efficiency of their homes as it does not proportionately increase the value of the property. Another widespread problem was that energy prices do not include all the negative external costs that the use of energy causes, such as pollution. The most commonly reported public policy measures in use related to information dissemination and subsidies for energy efficiency retrofits. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Taxation for urban waste management has been reformed in Italy by the introduction of an environmental law in 2006. In the planning phase of waste management, externalities generated by new facilities remain widely unaccounted, with a consequent distortion for prices, often raising local conflicts. The paper presents a survey based on the choice modelling methodology, aimed to evaluate on a monetary scale the disamenity effect perceived by incinerator and landfills in an Italian urban context: the city of Turin. In a random utility framework the behaviour of respondents, whose choices are found to be driven by the endowment of information about technological options, socio-economic characteristics as income, education, family composition, and also by their health status was modelled. Furthermore, empirical evidence that the behaviour in residential location choices is affected by different aspects of the respondent life and in particular by the health status was found. Distinct estimates of willingness to accept compensation for disamenity effects of incinerator ((sic)2670) and landfill ((sic)3816) are elicited. The effect of health status of the respondents, their level of information about the waste disposal infrastructure, the presence of a subjective strong aversion (NIMBY) and the actual endowment and concentration of infrastructures are demonstrated to be significant factors determining the choice behaviour, but differentiated and specific for incinerators and landfills.\n",

      "The Member States of the European Union have pledged to reduce by 20% the primary energy consumption to 2020. Since the energy consumption in residential and commercial buildings represents approximately 40% of total energy, it is possible to define a series of energy efficiency policies that allow improving the energy performance of dwellings as way to reach this objective. One of the main differences of these policies with respect to the Chilean Thermal Regulation is that the latter does not consider heat losses by air infiltration, which in practice may reduce or even eliminate the benefits generated in the context of the current building requirements. This study reviews the national standards of 14 European countries with regard to the limitation of heat losses by air infiltration, with the aim of discussing their evaluation system, measure units and extracting future lessons for the Chilean Thermal Regulation.\n",

      "Vehicle exhaust is a major source of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) in metropolitan cities. Popular community mode (buses and taxies) and about 2.4 million private cars are the main emission sources of air pollution in Tehran. A case survey has conducted to measure CO2 in four popular vehicles, bus, taxi, private car and motorcycle, which moved in the city with respectively 7800, 82358, 560000 and 2.4 million per day in 2012. Results indicated that the contribution of CO2 emissions increased in the following order: private car, motorcycle, bus and taxi. The overall average for the contribution of CO2 emissions in the private car, motorcycle, bus, and taxi were 26372, 1648, 1433 and 374 tons per day, respectively. Our results also showed that the urban transport operation consume an estimated 178 and 4224 million liter diesel and petrol per year, respectively, that have released about 10 million tons of CO2. The average contribution of CO2 emissions of private cars in Tehran was higher (88%) than other vehicles. It was concluded that high volume of traffic, transport consumption of fossil fuels and shortage of adequate public transport system are responsible for the high CO2 level in environment in Tehran. Thus, it is to be expected that CO2 as a greenhouse gas has risen in Tehran more than ever in the following years and this would be a matter of concern for the authorities to have a comprehensive plan to mitigate this phenomena.\n",

      "Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the residential sector by adopting technologies such as solar photovoltaics and electric vehicles (EVs) have major implications for the capacity of electricity distribution networks, particularly at local areas with high uptake. Consumer decisions to purchase these technologies are also influenced by several complex criteria such as costs/benefits, performance, appeal/status, risk, psychographics, and demographics. This complexity motivated the development of an innovative diffusion model, incorporating features of multi-criteria analysis and choice modelling, to estimate the adoption of these technology options spatially across the landscape of heterogeneous consumers. We test the model to forecast market share of EVs through to 2030, using the vehicle stock across all 1.5 million households in Victoria, Australia. Seven financial and non-financial criteria were included and calibrated via focus groups and a large-scale survey. Annual change of criteria values and their elasticity to adoption were incorporated. Geographical differences in uptake of EVs were primarily due to driving distance, employment status and household income, with urban areas having about three times the proportional uptake. By testing the model for a range of incentives, we demonstrate its capability to inform and evaluate policy options. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n",

      "This article presents a dynamic spatial model of the development of a charging infrastructure for electric vehicles in the German metropolitan region of Stuttgart. The model consists of several sub-models whose functioning and interactions are explained in detail. The first sub-model simulates the time-spatial development of electric vehicle ownership. The output of this module is used by the second component that determines the resulting demand for charging stations. To quantify this demand, the necessary utilisation of charging stations to allow for the profitability of the infrastructure is calculated. A final processing step simulates the mobility of EVs throughout the Region Stuttgart, and thus allows allocating the need for charging stations in space. We used our model to generate several scenarios of the development of a charging infrastructure in the Region Stuttgart until 2020. The main finding of this work is that the number of public charging stations needed for the region in the long run is quite low. If too many charging stations are installed the infrastructure will be under-utilized and thus cannot be operated economically. The simulation runs show that the installation of public charging infrastructure should be focused on the few biggest urban centres of the region. The scenarios also show that publicly accessible charging stations form only a minor part of the overall number of charging stations. Additionally, it can be seen that the exponential growth of electric vehicle ownership, with very few vehicles at the beginning, but large gains after a few years, requires high flexibility from stakeholders involved in the implementation of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles.\n",

      "The environmental and resource impacts of wooden single-family residences designed to meet the conventional Norwegian Building Code from 2010 (TEK10) and the Norwegian passive house standard NS 3700 are compared using life cycle assessment. Four different heating systems are evaluated for the two building designs: (1) electric (resistance heating), (2) electric and wood, (3) electric and a solar heat collector and (4) electric and an air-water heat pump system. The goal of the research is to evaluate the different ways of lowering the total environmental burden of a building's life cycle, considering the two building standards, and evaluating the impacts due to implementation of renewable heating systems in comparison to standard Norwegian systems largely based on electricity.The life cycle results show that the wood-framed single-family residence built according to the passive house standard provides a consistent and clear reduction of cumulative energy demand of 24-38% in comparison to the conventional building standard TEK10 with electric panel heating. In combination with efficient heating systems, a passive house building envelope with a heat pump system provides the largest savings, an improvement of almost 40% compared to a conventional house with electric heating. The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of the cleanest design compared to the standard alternative is almost 30%. Solar heated water also provides substantial environmental gains for the passive house. On the other hand, a standard building envelope with a heat-pump system reduces impacts to a level comparable to that of a passive house building with only electric heating. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

      "Low back pain (LBP) is common in occupational bus drivers and studies have shown a dose response relationship between whole body vibration (WBV) exposure and LBP. Bus design may be an important factor in determining the WBV exposure a bus driver receives. The purpose of this study was to determine whether differences exist in WBV exposures between two buses commonly used in long urban 'commuter routes: a high-floor coach and a low-floor city bus. Each bus was driven over a standardized test route which included four road types: a newer smooth freeway, a rougher old freeway, a city street segment, and a road segment containing several speed humps. WBV exposures were calculated per ISO 2631-1 (1997) and ISO 2631-5 (2004) standards. WBV exposures were significantly higher in the highfloor coach bus on the road segment containing speed humps. There were primarily small differences between buses in WBV exposures encountered on the city street and freeway segments. With respect to the ISO 2631-1 and European Union's A(8) and VDV(8) action limit values, both buses could be operated on the smooth freeway without exceeding the 8-hour action limits but would have to be operated less than 8 h when operating on the other road types. On average, the seats only attenuated 10% of the floor transmitted vibration and amplified the vibration exposures on the speed humps. Due to the low vibration attenuation performance of the bus driver's seat, evaluating different types of seats and seat suspensions may be merited. Relevance to industry: Low back Pain (LBP) is one of the leading causes for workplace disability; therefore, it would be beneficial for employers and workers to minimize WBV exposures resulting in LBP. To reduce WBV exposures, buses should be assigned to appropriate routes and drivers should rotate across routes to vary continuous and impulsive exposures. 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Climate change and its resulting uncertainties challenge the concepts, procedures, and scope of conventional approaches to planning, creating a need to rethink and revise current planning methods. This paper proposes a new conceptual framework for assessing city plans based on the idea of sustainability and planning countering climate change. It applies this framework to assess the recent master plan for the city of New York City: PlaNYC 2030. The framework consists of eight concepts that were identified through conceptual analyses of the planning and interdisciplinary literature on sustainability and climate change. Using the proposed conceptual framework to evaluate PlaNYC 2030 reveals some of the merits of the Plan. PlaNYC promotes greater compactness and density, enhanced mixed land use, sustainable transportation, greening, and renewal and utilization of underused land. With regard to the concept of uncertainty, it addresses future uncertainties related to climate change with institutional measures only. From the perspective of ecological economics, the Plan creates a number of mechanisms to promote its climate change goals and to create a cleaner environment for economic investment. It offers an ambitious vision of reducing emissions by 30% and creating a greener, greater New York, and links this vision with the international agenda for climate change. On the other hand, the assessment reveals that PlaNYC did not make a radical shift toward planning for climate change and adaptation. It inadequately addresses social planning issues that are crucial to New York City. NYC is socially differentiated in terms of the capacity of communities to meet climate change uncertainties, and the Plan fails to address the issues facing vulnerable communities due to climate change. The Plan calls for an integrative approach to climate change on the institutional level, but it fails to effectively integrate civil society, communities, and grassroots organizations into the process. The lack of a systematic procedure for public participation throughout the city's neighborhoods and among different social groupings and other stakeholders is a critical shortcoming, particularly during the current age of climate change uncertainty. Practically, the proposed conceptual framework of evaluate appears to be an effective and constructive means of illuminating the Plan's strengths and weaknesses, and appears to be an easy-to-grasp evaluation method, and should be easily understood and applied by scholars, practitioners and policy makers.\n",

A new taxonomy is required to help systematize and respond to basic sanitary needs. My aim was to test a new framework for understanding these concerns in periurban spaces. Methods. I conducted semistructured qualitative interviews with a randomized sample, stratified by settlement density, of mostly female-headed households in KaTembe, the largest municipal district of Maputo, Mozambique. The survey included questions on the adequacy, accessibility, and affordability of water, sanitation facilities, and waste management as well as awareness of illnesses and safe hygiene practices. Results. Despite being part of a capital city, KaTembe residents face a diverse mixture of sanitary challenges, as revealed through an analysis of adequacy, accessibility, affordability, and awareness issues. The interaction of these 4 lenses provides insight into residents' behaviors and the obstacles they face in securing adequate provisions. Conclusions. International water, sanitation, and hygiene studies continue to depend on urban-rural distinctions. However, an adequacy, accessibility, affordability, and awareness framework can improve the utility of their data. (Am J Public Health. 2012;102:256-261. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2011.300399)\n",

      "Although several studies analyze strategies for reducing transportation's contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, few do so at the local level, particularly for a city such as San Francisco, California, that is already a leader in climate-friendly transportation. This study examined nine GHG-reducing strategies within the San Francisco context, where local ordinance establishes a goal to reduce the city's GHGs 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. Strategies that were analyzed included infrastructure improvements, expansion of demand management policies including pricing, and accelerated penetration of electric vehicle technology. The study used a combination of travel demand model and sketch-planning methods to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of strategies in reducing GHGs and their cumulative ability to achieve San Francisco's goal. The analysis results showed roadway pricing and electric vehicle strategies to have had the largest potential to reduce GHGs, although these two strategies differed significantly in cost-effectiveness. The results also showed that strategies involving share costs between public sector, private sector, and individuals had great promise in delivering reductions. Although investments in transit alone may not produce large GHG reductions, they are necessary to accommodate the mode shift of other strategies and can be paired strategically with pricing strategies. According to analysis results, San Francisco's policy goals appeared unachievable, even with ambitious assumptions about funding and policy change. These findings point to the need for policy change at a higher scale and for unprecedented changes in individual behavior to achieve GHG goals.\n",

      "All buildings worldwide combined use 40% of the global energy and are responsible for one third of global energy-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The majority of GHG emissions of buildings come from fossil fuel energy in several stages of the life cycle of the building; 80%-90% of GHG emissions of buildings are emitted in the operations stage; 10%-20% GHG emissions are from embodied energy and carbon emissions related to construction stage. The greatest potential for low-hanging fruit in cost effective, quick, deep GHG reduction and mitigation is found in the construction industry. With currently available and proven technologies, reductions in energy consumption on both new and existing buildings are estimated to achieve 30%-80%. When costs of implementing energy reduction technologies are offset by energy savings, there is potential for a net profit over the life span of the building. Much has been done to study energy reductions, define GHG emissions, and develop metrics and protocols for measuring and reporting carbon emissions. This paper addresses the \"How.\" How energy consumption of a house was reduced almost 70%. How CO2 emission was reduced 44%. How embodied GHG emissions of the house were measured and certified carbon neutral. How USGBC LEED for Homes platinum certification was attained. How actual savings from energy reductions are able to pay back up-front cost of implementing technologies and begin earning a profit in fifteen years. How reducing electric consumption has the greatest impact in reducing energy costs and reducing CO2 emissions compared to propane and #2 fuel oil.

      "Background: Primary prevention measures are needed for Africa's cancer burden (715,000 new cases and 542,000 deaths in 2008), a burden projected to double by 2030 due to demographic changes alone. Control of cancer-causing infections and lifestyle-related carcinogens will play a significant role in prevention, but less often addressed are environmental and occupational contributions. Methods: We review environmental issues that contribute to Africa's Cancer burden. Results: We demonstrate evidence of the impact of environmental carcinogens on the cancer burden as of now and that circumstances present today may increase their contribution further. Suboptimal implementation and monitoring of environmental protection and of occupational health standards, including in the informal sector, use of outdated technologies in industry and lack of awareness of potential hazards in the specific employment structure give rise to high levels of exposures. Carcinogens of concern include (i) those that have been long present (e. g. indoor air pollution) whose contribution may increase as life-expectancy increases and long latency periods for cancer are realised, (ii) exposures in mining and agricultural sectors and (iii) modern environmental hazards, including urban air pollution and agents arising from the mis-management of hazardous waste from local, industrial and trans-boundary sources. Conclusions: Actions taken to reduce exposures and research to fill gaps in knowledge, adapted to local settings, could help mitigate the cancer burden. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

      "The NEDUM-2D model is used to downscale four global socio-economic scenarios at city scale and simulate the evolution of the Paris urban area between 1900 and 2100. It is based on a dynamic extension of the classical urban economic theory, to explain the spatial distribution of land and real estate values, dwelling surfaces, population density and building heights and density. A validation over the 1900-2010 period shows that the model reproduces available data and captures the main determinants of city shape evolution. From four global scenarios and additional local inputs, 32 local scenarios are created and analyzed.Main drivers of urban sprawl and climate and flood vulnerability appear to be local demographic growth and local policies; global factors, such as energy and transport prices, even including possible peak-oil and carbon taxes, have only a limited influence on them. Conversely, transport-related greenhouse gas emissions are mainly driven by global factors, namely vehicle efficiency changes, not by land use. As a consequence, very strict urban policies - including reconstruction - would become necessary to control emissions from urban transportation if technologies reveal unable to do so. These scenarios are a useful input for the design and assessment of mitigation and adaptation policies at local scale. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n",

      "South Africa's Province of Gauteng is a fast growing megacity region including the cities of Johannesburg and Tshwane. Increasing population and prosperity lead to a steadily growing energy demand and thereby increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. One third of the province's final energy consumption comes from the transport sector, dominated by motorized individual transport. Due to the limited financial resources to fund public transport initiatives, the most cost-effective means to reach the GHG mitigation targets are intended, without jeopardizing the economic growth. Recently, a bus rapid transit (BRT) system (Rea Vaya) and a rapid rail link (Gautrain) have been introduced to enforce the public transport system. In this paper, we investigate planned and possible future network expansions of the BRT and the Gautrain in terms of transport performance, costs of network expansions and GHG mitigation potential. Based on a trip rate model, we show that extensions of the current network can increase passenger numbers significantly (between 320% and 660% between 2013 and 2040 depending on the framework conditions). However, despite these expansions, the modal share of the BRT and the Gautrain in total passenger-kilometres travelled remains below 4% until 2040. This results in a decrease of cumulated GHG emissions of less than 1% until 2040 and relatively high GHG mitigation costs (4948-30045 ZAR(2013)/t CO(2)e). Nevertheless, a better integration of all public transport systems can increase the attractiveness of the services, which can result in a higher modal shift from private cars and thereby higher GHG emissions reductions at lower costs.

      "The City of Stockholm is making substantial efforts towards meeting its climate change commitments including a GHG emission target of 3 tonnes per capita by 2020 and making its new eco-district Stockholm Royal Seaport a candidate of Clinton Climate Initiative's Climate Positive Program. Towards achieving these policies, this study evaluated the energy efficiency potential in the city, in collaboration with the district heating and electricity utility Fortum. Drawing on their vast billing meter data on the housing stock in Stockholm, a new understanding of energy use in the city emerged. Analysis of the energy efficiency potential of different building vintages revealed that the retrofitting potential of the building stock to current building codes would reduce heating energy use by one third. In terms of market segmentation, the greatest reduction potential in total energy was found to be for buildings constructed between 1946 and 1975. This is due to the large number of buildings constructed during that era and their poor energy performance. However, the least energy-efficient buildings were those built between 1926 and 1945 in contradiction to commonly held beliefs. These findings indicate the need for a shift in public policy towards the buildings with highest retrofitting potential. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "The environmental and economic assessment of neighborhood-scale transit-oriented urban form changes should include initial construction impacts through long-term use to fully understand the benefits and costs of smart growth policies. The long-term impacts of moving people closer to transit require the coupling of behavioral forecasting with environmental assessment. Using new light rail and bus rapid transit in Los Angeles, California as a case study, a life-cycle environmental and economic assessment is developed to assess the potential range of impacts resulting from mixed-use infill development. An integrated transportation and land use life-cycle assessment framework is developed to estimate energy consumption, air emissions, and economic (public, developer, and user) costs. Residential and commercial buildings, automobile travel, and transit operation changes are included and a 60-year forecast is developed that compares transit-oriented growth against growth in areas without close access to high-capacity transit service. The results show that commercial developments create the greatest potential for impact reductions followed by residential commute shifts to transit, both of which may be effected by access to high-capacity transit, reduced parking requirements, and developer incentives. Greenhouse gas emission reductions up to 470 Gg CO2-equivalents per year can be achieved with potential costs savings for TOD users. The potential for respiratory impacts (PM-m-equivalents) and smog formation can be reduced by 28-35%. The shift from business-as-usual growth to transit-oriented development can decrease user costs by $3100 per household per year over the building lifetime, despite higher rental costs within the mixed-use development.

      "The global burden of disease study estimated 695,000 premature deaths in 2010 due to continued exposure to outdoor particulate matter and ozone pollution for India. By 2030, the expected growth in many of the sectors (industries, residential, transportation, power generation, and construction) will result in an increase in pollution related health impacts for most cities. The available information on urban air pollution, their sources, and the potential of various interventions to control pollution, should help us propose a cleaner path to 2030. In this paper, we present an overview of the emission sources and control options for better air quality in Indian cities, with a particular focus on interventions like urban public transportation facilities; travel demand management; emission regulations for power plants; clean technology for brick kilns; management of road dust; and waste management to control open waste burning. Also included is a broader discussion on key institutional measures, like public awareness and scientific studies, necessary for building an effective air quality management plan in Indian cities.

      "Transportation planning is changing. What used to be a concern with motorized vehicles only is evolving into a discipline dealing with multimodal systems where priority is given to transit and nonmotorized means of transport, chief among them being walking. The city of Bat Yam in Israel has chosen to pioneer planning for pedestrians as an integral component of its transportation master plan. This article presents a novel use of pedestrian movement modeling within urban transportation planning, by means of pedestrian movement volume prediction maps for the city, both at its current state today and at its future state planned for the year 2030. The study shows that a pedestrian movement distribution can be explained mainly by the spatial variables that represent properties of a street network. Changes to this network structure are relatively rare, and, therefore, pedestrian movement will not change in a fundamental way in the future. Furthermore, by overlaying the models for pedestrian movement and motorized traffic, as well as the underlying public transit and bicycle networks, focus can be on those streets and places where conflicts among the various road users (i.e., pedestrians, bicycles, transit vehicles, and private cars) are expected.\n",

      "During 1990-2010, the power generation sector has been the highest energy consuming and CO2 emitting sector while the residential and building sectors have been the largest electricity consuming sector, accounted for about 57.1% of overall electricity consumption in Thailand. This study employed AIM/Enduse model to investigate the CO2 reduction measures which are related to the marginal abatement cost (MAC) in the long term planning. Seven mitigation measures by replacing existing energy devices with more efficient ones based on the data currently available on the market are implemented: (1) efficient lighting devices, (2) efficient cooling devices, (3) efficient heating devices, (4) efficient other electrical devices, (5) efficient cooking devices, (6) Insulated houses, and (7) building codes. Results indicate that in the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario between 2010 and 2050, the energy demand and CO2 emissions would increase to 39,140 ktoe and 52,047 kt-CO2, respectively. By adopting these policy strategies, energy demand can be reduced by about 42.7% of total energy demand in 2050 while CO2 emissions can be mitigated by 35.0% of overall CO2 emissions in 2050. The efficient cooling devices will contribute to the largest CO2 reduction in 2050 with low MAC when compared to other measures. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "A holistic approach to residential water heating systems specification is required to provide optimal energy efficiency. The objective of this study is to analyse the performance of residential water heating systems for the city of Brisbane in Australia, for different combinations of heating system technologies (solar, heat pump, electric), storage tank sizes (1251, 2501, 3251), time-distribution of energy in accordance to the tariff selection (all-day, controlled, night off-peak) and washing machine water heating sources (internal and external). Performance assessments considered the influence of 54 different water heating system configurations on the electricity grid (i.e. power peaks, time-distribution of energy according to electricity tariffs, and energy intensity), as well as their level of service (i.e. compliance rates with recommended hot water temperatures), Empirical water end use data from 27 households was utilised to model the performance of water heating systems. The study demonstrated that beyond merely specifying the type of technology (e.g. solar hot water), other key criteria such as hot water demand, hot water tank size and electricity tariff selection should also be considered in order to systematically optimise the energy and service performance of hot water systems in residential buildings.

      "Building envelope, which separates the interior conditioned from exterior unconditioned environment of a building, is the key determinant of thermal and energy performance in many types of buildings. The building envelope is primarily designed to restrict the heat transfer between inside and outside in order to regulate the thermal characteristics of the interior environment and reduce the heating, cooling and electric lighting demand of buildings. The key goal of the present research is to examine the life cycle energy and environmental performance of building envelopes by conducting a comparative energy and environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) study of several envelope scenarios in which some of the major components of building envelope vary. The varying components include insulation material, window-to-wall ratio (WWR), window frame material, and double-glazing cavity gas. The generic building model used in this study was a hypothetical 2-story office building with 335 m(2) (3600 ft(2)) of floor area. The results revealed scenarios with low to medium WWR and fiberglass window frame result in the lowest impacts. The research also shows that use phase of the life cycle is the primary contributor to most environmental impact categories for all scenarios. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "In the past four decades following the global oil crisis in 1973, Denmark has implemented remarkable changes in its energy sector, mainly due to the energy conservation measures on the demand side and the energy efficiency improvements on the supply side. Nowadays, the capital intensive infrastructure investments, such as the expansion of district heating networks and the introduction of significant heat saving measures require highly detailed decision-support tool. A Danish heat atlas provides highly detailed database with extensive information about more than 2.5 million buildings in Denmark. Energy system analysis tools incorporate environmental, economic, energy and engineering analysis of future energy systems and are considered crucial for the quantitative assessment of transitional scenarios towards future milestones, such as EU 2020 goals and Denmark's goal of achieving fossil free society after 2050. The present paper shows how a Danish heat atlas can be used for providing inputs to energy system models, especially related to the analysis of heat saving measures within building stock and expansion of district heating networks. As a result, marginal cost curves are created, approximated and prepared for the use in optimization energy system model. Moreover, it is concluded that heat atlas can contribute as a tool for data storage and visualisation of results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "In order to meet the recycling and recovery targets set forth by the European Union's (EU) Waste and Landfill Directives, both the Irish and Czech governments' policy on waste management is changing to meet these pressures, with major emphasis being placed upon the management of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW). In particular, the EU Landfill Directive requires reductions in the rate of BMW going to landfill to 35% of 1995 values by 2016 and 2020 for Ireland and the Czech Republic, respectively. In this paper, the strategies of how Ireland and the Czech Republic plan to meet this challenge are compared. Ireland either landfills or exports its waste for recovery, while the Czech Republic has a relatively new waste management infrastructure. While Ireland met the first target of 75% diversion of BMW from landfill by 2010 and preliminary 2012 data indicate that Ireland is on track to meet the 2013 target, the achievement of the 2016 target remains at risk. Indicators that were developed to monitor the Czech Republic's path to meeting the targets demonstrate that it did not meet the first target that was set for 2010 and will probably not meet its 2013 target either. The evaluation reports on the implementation of Waste Management Plan of Czech Republic suggest that the currently applied strategy to divert biodegradable waste from landfill is not effective enough. For both countries, the EU Waste Framework and Landfill Directives will be a significant influence and driver of change in waste management practices and governance over the coming decade. This means that both countries will not only have to invest in infrastructure to achieve the targets, but will also have to increase awareness among the public in diverting this waste at the household level. Improving environmental education is part of increased awareness as it is imperative for citizens to understand the consequences of their actions as affluence continues to grow producing increased levels of waste.

      "According to the recast of the Energy Performance Building Directive, Member States must give an exact definition for nearly zero-energy buildings to be introduced from 2018/2020. The requirement system stipulating the sustainable development of the building sector is usually based on the analysis of a few reference buildings, combining energy efficiency measures and HVAC systems. The risk of this method is that depending on the assumptions either the requirements do not provide sufficient incentives for energy saving measures and renewables or the requirements cannot be fulfilled with rational solutions in many cases. Our method is based on the artificial generation of a large building sample, where the buildings are defined by geometric and other parameters. Due to the large number of combinations, the effect of many variables appear in the results, with the deviations reflecting the sensitivity of the energy balance. The requirements are set based on some fundamental considerations and the statistical analysis of the sample. The method is demonstrated on the example of setting the requirements for residential buildings in Hungary. The proposed requirements are validated against the common European targets. The suggested method is suitable for developing building energy regulation threshold values, certification schemes or benchmarking values. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Electricity consumption of the Chinese building materials industry accounted for 8.4% of industrial and 6.2% of national electricity usage in 2011. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the future electricity intensity and conservation potential of the Chinese building materials industry. This paper adopts a cointegration method to establish a long-run equilibrium relationship between electricity intensity and factors including technology, power tariff, enterprise scale and value-added per worker. Electricity conservation potential in the Chinese building materials industry is predicted to be 90.5 billion kWh in 2020 under the moderate scenario, which is more than the total electricity consumption of Malaysia in 2007; and 150.9 billion kWh under the advanced scenario, which is more than the total electricity consumption of Saudi Arabia in 2005. Conserved electricity in building materials industry would account for 1.2% and 2.0% of national electricity consumption under the two scenarios, respectively. More importantly, we find that the electricity intensity gap between Chinese and the world's leading building materials industries could be significantly narrowed by 2020 if aggressive energy conservation policies were implemented.

      "Many vehicle owners in the United States recharge their vehicles' air conditioning systems with small containers of hydrofluorocarbon-134a (HFC-134a, CH2FCF3), at a frequency estimated to be once every year on average. Such nonprofessional service produces immediate emissions of this potent greenhouse gas during service and from the residual heel in partially used containers. The nonprofessional operations are also associated with increased delayed refrigerant emissions that occur because owners are less likely to repair leaks than professional technicians. In California, an estimated 1.3 million nonprofessional service operations performed each year generate 0.27 +/- 0.07 million metric ton CO2 equivalent (MMTCO(2)e) of immediate emissions and 0.54 +/- 0.08 MMTCO(2)e of delayed emissions, using a Global Warming Potential of 1300 for HFC-134a. The immediate emissions can be largely mitigated by a regulation that requires self-sealing valves and improved labeling instructions on the containers, a deposit-return-recycling program for the containers, and a consumer education program. If 95% of the used containers were to be returned by consumers for recycling of the container heel, the annual immediate emissions would be reduced by 0.26 +/- 0.07 MMTCO(2)e. In the United States, an estimated 24 million nonprofessional service operations are performed each year, generating 5.1 +/- 1.4 MMTCO(2)e of immediate emissions and 10.4 +/- 1.5 MMTCO(2)e of delayed emissions. Mitigation measures equivalent to the California regulation would reduce nationwide immediate emissions by 4.9 +/- 1.4 MMTCO(2)e, if 95% of the used cans were returned for recycling. These business-as-usual emissions and mitigation potentials are projected to stay approximately constant until around 2022, and remain at significant levels into the 2030s. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Objectives. We assessed the potential public health benefit of the National Bus Pass, introduced in 2006, which permits free local bus travel for older adults (>= 60 years) in England. Methods. We performed regression analyses with annual data from the 2005-2008 National Travel Survey. Models assessed associations between being a bus pass holder and active travel (walking, cycling, and use of public transport), use of buses, and walking 3 or more times per week. Results. Having a free pass was significantly associated with greater active travel among both disadvantaged (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 4.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]= 3.35, 4.86; P<.001) and advantaged groups (AOR = 4.72; 95% CI = 3.99, 5.59; P<.001); greater bus use in both disadvantaged and advantaged groups (AOR = 7.03; 95% CI = 5.53, 8.94; P<.001 and AOR = 7.11; 95% CI = 5.65, 8.94; P<.001, respectively); and greater likelihood of walking more frequently in the whole cohort (AOR = 1.15; 95% CI = 1.07, 1.12; P<.001).

      "Background: From 2003 to 2008, a total of 25 community partnerships funded through Active Living by Design (ALbD) implemented physical activity programs and promotions as part of integrated approaches complementing policy and environment changes. Purpose: This paper reviews the partnerships' efforts with respect to promotions and programs, the breadth and depth of these types of approaches, challenges, successes, and lessons learned. Methods: Through a mixed-methods approach, including interviews, focus groups, and web-based tracking, multiple sources of data were collected and analyzed from 2006 to 2010. Evaluators summarized quantitative data by counts or means and qualitative results using systematic coding procedures to identify themes, ideas, and concepts. Results: All 25 community partnerships were engaged in programs and promotions of varying degrees throughout the initiative. Programs were categorized as community walking and biking programs, school programs, afterschool programs, and worksite programs, among others. Promotional strategies were categorized as social marketing campaigns, media, events, and communications. The most common programs included Safe Routes to School, walking clubs, and Bike/Walk to School Day. Media efforts were undertaken by all 25 partnerships, totaling 2659 TV, newspaper, and radio hits. Conclusions: Programs and promotions can be resource-intensive and have limited population impact when offered in isolation; however, these strategies help connect people to their environments (e.g., increase awareness of facilities, provide social support for use of facilities) in order to improve physical activity behaviors.

      "Background: Motor vehicle emissions contribute nearly a quarter of the world's energy-related greenhouse gases and cause non-negligible air pollution, primarily in urban areas. Changing people's travel behaviour towards alternative transport is an efficient approach to mitigate harmful environmental impacts caused by a large number of vehicles. Such a strategy also provides an opportunity to gain health co-benefits of improved air quality and enhanced physical activities. This study aimed at quantifying co-benefit effects of alternative transport use in Adelaide, South Australia.Method: We made projections for a business-as-usual scenario for 2030 with alternative transport scenarios. Separate models including air pollution models and comparative risk assessment health models were developed to link alternative transport scenarios with possible environmental and health benefits.Results: In the study region with an estimated population of 1.4 million in 2030, by shifting 40% of vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT) by passenger vehicles to alternative transport, annual average urban PM2.5 would decline by approximately 0.4 mu g/m(3) compared to business-as-usual, resulting in net health benefits of an estimated 13 deaths/year prevented and 118 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) prevented per year due to improved air quality. Further health benefits would be obtained from improved physical fitness through active transport (508 deaths/year prevented, 6569 DALYs/year prevented), and changes in traffic injuries (21 deaths and, 960 DALYs prevented).Conclusion: Although uncertainties remain, our findings suggest that significant environmental and health benefits are possible if alternative transport replaces even a relatively small portion of car trips. The results may provide assistance to various government organisations and relevant service providers and promote collaboration in policy-making, city planning and infrastructure establishment.

The ensuing travel demand is expected to aggravate chaos in transport systems for almost all major African cities. This paper analyses the emerging paradoxes in the BRT system in Dar as Salaam city where the provision of an organized, affordable and cost-effective public transport system has been eagerly awaited by city residents. However, the Dar Rapid Transit (DART) system, recently established, has astonishingly witnessed opposition from some of the city residents. Findings reveal that the underlying reasons for this paradoxical situation include absence of a current land use plan, ineffective land use control and little adherence to the legal provision for property compensation and resettlement. Lack of common understanding between the government and the affected people, deters the implementation of Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system in the city. A well organised and inclusive framework of stakeholders and a well structured information dissemination system are the pillars on which successful MRT system can be built. Compensation payment to affected people, at market price, cannot be avoided in MRT development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Semi-natural vegetation in agricultural land mainly includes extensively managed grasslands, agro-forestry areas and all vegetated features that are not used for crop production, such as hedgerows, buffer strips, field margins and woodlots. Semi-natural vegetation plays a major role in the supply of ecosystem services such as pollination, pest control, water quality control and erosion prevention. The efficiency of ecosystem services for agriculture should therefore depend upon the spatial distribution of semi-natural vegetation. In spite of such a relevance, semi-natural vegetation in agricultural land has never been mapped at the European scale. Therefore, we report here the first 1- km resolution map of semi-natural vegetation in agricultural land at the European Union scale. For that, we use an innovative convergence-of-evidence mapping method. We also present an assessment and a classification of the relation between semi-natural vegetation and ecosystem service supply at the regional scale. The major improvements in our mapping method are the following: (1) both large and small patches of perennial vegetation are detected in fine-resolution satellite images by incorporating the spectral rule-based preliminary classifier, (2) the identification of semi-natural grassland is enhanced, (3) European ancillary maps are used to help mapping of woody vegetation and identification of agro-ecosystems. Validation shows that our output map is 34.3 % more accurate than pre-existing components. In addition, results show that regulating ecosystem services increase with the abundance of semi-natural vegetation in agricultural lands with a coefficient R (2) of 0.67. The results also show no specific trend in relation to provisioning ecosystem services. These findings mean that semi-natural vegetation is usually beneficial for regulating services, whereas the relation to provisioning services is strictly context-dependent. Overall our study supports greening measures design in the frame of the Common Agricultural Policy for 2014-2020. Results also will help to identify green infrastructure elements and priority areas for ecological restoration.\n",

Electricity systems are also facing technical issues of bi-directional power flows, increasing distances of power flows, and a growing contribution from generation sources with limited dispatch capability. There is a concern that these systems are vulnerable.Transition pathways research using a multi-level perspective has identified a general picture of the drivers in future electricity systems architecture. In such futures, the vulnerability of electricity systems becomes multi-dimensional, and security becomes a more complex issue than that of supply of fossil fuels.The aim of this work is a critical analysis into the Government's 2050 pathway scenarios for the UK with respect to their impact locally on the electricity distribution network in a case study urban area in the North East of England. A simplified electricity network model is created to evaluate network performance under the seven pathway scenarios. The results of the study show clearly that under the 2050 assumptions for growth of electricity demand and renewables uptake, problems arise for the present day local electricity distribution system.

      "This paper has the general purpose of analyzing the spatiotemporal variation of the amount of collected domestic solid waste (DSW) in Joao Pessoa districts between 2003 and 2010. The methodology accomplished a preliminary consistency analysis of DSW data, followed by determining per capita of DSW, annual variation rates of absolute values and per capita of DSW, correlation analysis for the year 2010 between DSW per capita and variables representing income, education, energy and water per capita consumption, and three future scenarios of DSW collection were traced until 2030. It was estimated an increase of 32.4% for the total DSW collected in the period 2003-2010, reaching in 2010 an equivalent to 0.806 kg.person(-1).day (-1), which is coherent with an earlier study that has monitored three single-family residences in the city. Such an increase is consequence not only of the population growth (15.1%), but also due to intensification in goods consumption. The relationship between DSW production and consumption patterns was highlighted by the strong correlation found between per capita of collected DSW and per capita of energy consumption, education and income variables. This corroborates the need of a cultural change regarding consumption, misuse and discard of solid waste towards environmental sustainability. If the rate of solid waste generation keeps growing, it is projected between 0.85 and 1.88 kg.person(-1).day (-1) about 2030, which will increase the challenge of collecting the DSW, landfill disposing and management, and the need of actions to mitigate potential environmental impacts.\n",

      "By 2020, the vehicle population in China will likely exceed 280 million exacerbating national energy security, urban air pollution, and traffic congestion. In response, many local and regional governments in China are pursuing an expanding array of measures to restrain growth in personal vehicle ownership and, along with the central government, reducing emissions and energy use of vehicles. One prominent strategy is the promotion of new energy vehicles, especially plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). Large subsidies were offered up to $27,600 (171,000 RMB) per vehicle in some regions, including almost $9200 (57,000 RMB) from the central government which suggests that China is making a major commitment to PEVs. But sales have been meager. In 2013, only 17,600 PEVs, mostly buses and utility trucks, were sold, less than 0.1% of total civilian vehicle sales. Several factors explain the failure of PEV sales to take off: (1) protectionism by local governments; (2) uncertainty over which electric-drive vehicle technologies to promote and what consumers are willing to pay, (3) lagging investments in charging infrastructure, and (4) conservative investment behavior by automakers and battery manufacturers. The central government issued directives to local governments in late 2013 to reduce barriers to out-of-town companies, resulting in modest sales increases in early 2014, but a more coherent, broader, and effective set of policies, incentives, and strategies are needed to overcome consumer and industry resistance and the lack of charging infrastructure.

An increasing amount of energy will be steadily consumed in the building sector as the urbanization process accelerates. China's government attaches great importance to building energy efficiency (BEE). How does the urbanization process affect building energy consumption (BEC)? How much energy can be saved in the building sector through implementation of energy polices? These questions are critical for government development strategies and planning. Thus, in this paper, an econometric model (co-integration technique) is developed to analyze how China's BEC is affected by macroeconomic variables in the context of urbanization, and also forecast the BEC and BEE potential until 2020 under different scenarios. The research result shows that occupants' lifestyles, residents' living standards, and energy price have significant influences on BEC. The building sector is likely to contribute approximately 20% to China's energy conservation through electricity pricing reform. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "The pressuring need to reduce the import of fossil fuels as well as the need to dramatically reduce CO2 emissions in Europe motivated the European Commission (EC) to implement several regulations directed to building owners. Most of these regulations focus on increasing the number of energy efficient buildings, both new and retrofitted, since retrofits play an important role in energy efficiency. Overall, this initiative results from the realization that buildings will have a significant impact in fulfilling the 20/20/20-goals of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, increasing energy efficiency by 20%, and increasing the share of renewables to 20%, all by 2020.The Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model (DER-CAM) is an optimization tool used to support DER investment decisions, typically by minimizing total annual costs or CO2 emissions while providing energy services to a given building or microgrid site. This paper shows enhancements made to DER-CAM to consider building retrofit measures along with DER investment options. Specifically, building shell improvement options have been added to DER-CAM as alternative or complementary options to investments in other DER such as PV, solar thermal, combined heat and power, or energy storage. The extension of the mathematical formulation required by the new features introduced in DER-CAM is presented and the resulting model is demonstrated at an Austrian Campus building by comparing DERCAM results with and without building shell improvement options. Strategic investment results are presented and compared to the observed investment decision at the test site. Results obtained considering building shell improvement options suggest an optimal weighted average U value of about 0.53 W/(m(2) K) for the test site. This result is approximately 25% higher than what is currently observed in the building, suggesting that the retrofits made in 2002 were not optimal. Furthermore, the results obtained with DER-CAM illustrate the complexity of interactions between DER and passive measure options, showcasing the need for a holistic optimization approach to effectively optimize energy costs and CO2 emissions. The simultaneous optimization of building shell improvements and DER investments enables building owners to take one step further towards nearly zero energy buildings (nZEB) or nearly zero carbon emission buildings (nZCEB), and therefore support the 20/20/20 goals.

      "This analysis of selected community and maternal characteristics influencing duration of breastfeeding in Vietnam utilized data from the 1988 Demographic and Health Survey and 1990 Accessibility of Contraceptives Survey available for the 4434 children born to 2769 women having their last birth between 1983-88. Explanatory variables included as covariates in the hazards model were mother's education, age of the mother at the time of the child's birth, birth order, and gender of the child, urban versus rural residence, infant mortality risk in the child's province, locality (mountains and highlands compared to delta and coastal), and region of the country (north, south). Indicators of development in the child's village included availability of electricity and public transportation. Breastfeeding duration was longer among the more highly educated women and among those women living in provinces with higher infant mortality. However, there were no significant differences in the duration of breastfeeding with variations among certain development characteristics of the village. Although there were regional differences in the duration of breastfeeding for the rural population, there were no regional differences for the overall population. There were no significant variations in the duration of breastfeeding by age of the mother, birth order or gender of the child. Although there were significant variations in duration of breastfeeding by some maternal and community characteristics, between 80-90 per cent of all women breastfeed for at least the first year of the child's life.\n",

      "This study examined the generation of litter, defined as spillage and uncollected residue, from a curbside collection system for residential recycling. The primary recycling containers used in the study were 18-gal (68 L), open-top bins. The study, conducted over a seven-week period, was comprised of both an urban and suburban area. Six litter characterizations were conducted in which all new litter larger than 1 in.(2) was collected, segregated, counted, and weighed. We found that each week the open-top recycling bins contributed approximately 20,590 pieces of litter over 1 in. in size per every 1000 households, which resulted in the generation of 3.74 tons of litter per 1000 households per year. In addition to the bins having no top, the primary root causes of the litter were constantly overflowing recycling bins, the method of collection, and material scavenging. Based on an estimated cost of litter cleanup ranging from $0.17 to $0.79 per piece of litter, the direct economic costs from the collection of litter and loss in recycling revenues were estimated at US$3920 to US$19,250 per 1000 households per year. Other notable impacts from the litter, such as increased risk of flood damage from storm drain impairment and marine ecosystem damages exist, but were not monetized. The results strongly suggest that modification of the curbside collection system would decrease the amount and associated cost of litter by replacing existing curbside collection containers with larger volume containers with covers and by modifying the task based incentive system to emphasize litter prevention rather than the current aim of completing the task most quickly.

      "The Chinese government has now published its emission reduction goal of carbon dioxide by 2020 and any industrial player is obliged to take effective initiatives to decrease its carbon footprint. For the city logistics distribution system, as a significant energy-consuming and pollutant-emitting sector, energy saving and emission reduction are very meaningful especially for megacities like Beijing. With rational hypotheses and parameter design, meanwhile considering the deployment of low-carbon resources, a novel carbon tax-constrained city logistics distribution network planning model is proposed. The model is a \"bilinear non-convex mixed integer programming and is reduced to a pure linear mixed integer programming through proper linearization. To verify the effectiveness of the model, an empirical study is conducted on a city logistics operator in Beijing and the popular commercial optimization suite IBM ILOG CPLEX is adopted for optimization purpose. Through analysis of the optimization results and comparison with traditional optimization models, it is found that the proposed model can help the city logistics distribution operator save up to 9.2% of operational cost during a full service cycle, and meanwhile cut down its carbon dioxide discharge by around 54.5% or 2135 metric tons at most.

      "Tremendous amounts of wastes are generated in urban areas due to accelerating industrialization and urbanization. The current unreasonable waste disposal patterns and potential energy value of urban wastes necessitates the promotion of waste-to-energy implementation. This study is intent on discovering the complete energy, economic and environmental potentials of urban wastes taking municipal solid wastes, waste oil, organic wastewater and livestock manure into consideration. A waste-to-energy system is constructed incorporating these wastes and five waste-to-energy technologies. A novel input-output simulation model is developed and applied to a metropolis to introduce the waste-to energy system into the current socioeconomic system and form five waste-to-energy industries. The trends in waste generation and energy recovery potential, economic benefits and greenhouse gas mitigation contribution for the study area are estimated and explored from 2011 to 2025. By 2025, biodiesel production and power generation could amount to 72.11 thousand t and 1.59 billion kW h respectively. Due to the highest energy recovery and the most subsidies, the organic wastewater biogas industry has the highest output and net profit, followed by the waste incineration power generation industry. In total 17.97 million t (carbon dioxide-equivalent) accumulative greenhouse gas emission could be mitigated. The organic wastewater biogas industry and waste incineration power generation industry are more advantageous for the study area in terms of better energy, economic and environmental performances. The methods presented and the quantified energy, economic and environmental potentials of urban wastes are expected to provide local decision makers with options for sounder waste management.

      "The article uses the Gothenburg congestion charge scheme, implemented in 2013, as a case study to analyze the effects and perceptions of a policy instrument directly aimed to change the travel behavior of individuals. For the study, a survey was conducted including measures of commuting habits, attitudes (toward the congestion charge, the environment, automobility, and public transport), and satisfaction with travel, along with socio-demographic and geographical variables. The survey was distributed to a panel of 3500 car owners in the Gothenburg region before the implementation of the scheme, with a follow-up one year later. The analysis use group comparisons and a binary logistic regression analysis and results show that the difference in accessibility of different societal functions using private versus public transport affected the propensity to reduce car travel, whereas socio-demographic variables had a low statistical significance, with the exception of women who were twice as likely to reduce their car travel than men. All studied groups reported a more positive view of the scheme at follow-up, although this effect was more pronounced among those adapting their commuting behavior. In none of the studied groups did the implementation of the congestion charge scheme correlate with any significant change in satisfaction with travel. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Objectives: The objective of this article is to assess the status of road safety in Asia and present accident and injury prevention strategies based on global road safety improvement experiences and discuss the way forward by indicating opportunities and countermeasures that could be implemented to achieve a new level of safety in Asia. Methods: This study provides a review and analyses of data in the literature, including from the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank, and a review of lessons learned from best practices in high-income countries. In addition, an estimation of costs due to road transport injuries in Asia and review of future trends in road transport is provided. Results: Data on the global and Asian road safety problem and status of prevention strategies in Asia as well as recommendations for future actions are discussed. The total number of deaths due to road accidents in the 24 Asian countries, encompassing 56% of the total world population, is 750,000 per year (statistics 2010). The total number of injuries is more than 50 million, of which 12% are hospital admissions. The loss to the economy in the 24 Asian countries is estimated to around US$800 billion or 3.6% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Conclusions: This article clearly shows that road safety is causing large problems and high costs in Asia, with an enormous impact on the well-being of people, economy, and productivity. In many Asian low- and middle-income countries, the yearly number of fatalities and injuries is increasing. Vulnerable road users (pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists combined) are particularly at risk. Road safety in Asia should be given rightful attention, including taking powerful, effective actions. This review stresses the need for reliable accident data, because there is considerable underreporting in the official statistics. Reliable accident data are imperative to determine evidence-based intervention strategies and monitor the success of these interventions and analyses. On the other hand, lack of good high-quality accident data should not be an excuse to postpone interventions. There are many opportunities for evidence-based transport safety improvements, including measures concerning the 5 key risk factors: speed, drunk driving, not wearing motorcycle helmets, not wearing seat belts, and not using child restraints in cars, as specified in the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020. In this commentary, a number of additional measures are proposed that are not covered in the Decade of Action Plan. These new measures include separate roads or lanes for pedestrians and cyclists; helmet wearing for e-bike riders; special attention to elderly persons in public transportation; introduction of emerging collision avoidance technologies, in particular automatic emergency braking (AEB) and alcohol locks; improved truck safety focusing on the other road user (including blind spot detection technology; underride protection at the front, rear, and side; and energy-absorbing fronts); and improvements in motorcycle safety concerning protective clothing, requirements for advanced braking systems, improved visibility of motorcycles by using daytime running lights, and better guardrails.\n",

      "The objective of this article is to find a way to pursue optimum spatial policy on the local level to meet the assumptions of the energy policy of the European Union. Factors influencing changes in the energy efficiency of selected buildings were modeled using logic based on radial neural networks. An attempt was made to economically justify the future of energy efficient civil engineering on the basis of research carried out in the town of Zielona Gora, taking into account the possibility of obtaining financial means from the European Union in the new perspective for the years 2014-2020. The main institutions responsible for monitoring the processes of restricting demand for energy are town and administrative commune authorities. Because of the necessity to coordinate processes of achieving the values specified by the European Commission the energy balance of buildings, residential areas and towns should be improved. Public intervention is necessary in the form of financial aid, tax exemptions, promotions etc. stimulating rational use of energy in households.One of the possible ways of developing energy efficient civil engineering is varied town policy and programs supporting energy efficient buildings. A second is the use of renewable energy sources as a factor improving the energy safety of built areas and reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. A third is the optimization of expenditure on these goals in towns.Although our current research and estimations based on it are limited to a medium-sized town in the west of Poland, the observations included in this article may be important for other regions that are interested in reducing energy consumption in buildings, residential areas and towns. Taking into account the geographical context, it is especially important for these regions of Europe that are obtaining financial aid from the European Union in the perspective for th(e) years 2014-2020.

      "The necessity to reduce energy requirements of lighting systems should bring among engineers a more mature and conscious vision while planning and this means that their main goals should be the visual comfort and a decrease in energy and maintenance costs. Therefore this paper examines the case study of a classroom located in the Faculty of Engineering of Sapienza University in Rome and, to evaluate the possibility to combine natural and artificial light, it focuses on the realization of a new lighting system. This new solution is formed by LED sources and control systems able to modulate the power absorbed by every single lamp (to adapt, according to the hour and day, to the conditions of the natural light). In order to meet the EN 12464-1, the process of incorporating natural and artificial light must occur while guaranteeing both the minimum levels expected for the average illuminance E-m [lx] and the uniformity coefficient (E-min/E-m) and this is the reason why a simultaneous exertion of artificial lights and a variable shielding system of glass surfaces activated through a motorized electronic control unit is required. Thanks to the software DIALux Evo 5.1 a 3D model of the classroom was reproduced and validated in order to simulate the combination of natural and artificial lighting and to verify if the results complied with the regulations. This was followed by an analysis concerning: the reliability of the system (through the examination of the MTBF - Mean Time Between Failure) and energetic and economic aspects (through the software ecoCALC 4.5.4). The novelty of this study is represented by the fact that in order to obtain the highest results in each of the three fields examined, it is possible to avoid the exertion of those negative feedback control-type systems (requiring high installation and maintenance costs due to sensor devices), thanks to pre-programmed logic control systems based on the data obtained with the simulations by prediction softwares. In this case study the solution suggested, while using a pre-programmed control logic, presents a MTBF of 1205 h (about twice of a negative feedback system solution) with payback periods that justify the higher costs presented by the electronic characterizing the control logic system with respect to traditional plant solutions.

Furthermore, noise pollution and it's both direct and indirect consequences are studied.After having analyzed Madrid's situation, a comparison between some international cities and the Spanish capital is made, regarding their vehicle fleet and their environmental and economical consequences. European environmental policy and future criteria are exposed.Regarding the technical feasibility, two types of zero-emission technologies are considered, the battery-electric car and de hydrogen fuel cell vehicle (FCV). After having described the benefits and disadvantages of the use of zero-emission vehicles, a macroeconomic analysis is done in order to study the economic feasibility of the project. To do this, not only several economic variables, such as gross domestic product in the area, but also survey data, such as the average daily driving time are considered.Finally, a strategic plan for a gradual implementation of zero-emission vehicles in the city of Madrid is proposed, taking into account the quantity of emissions saved if the electrical energy needed is generated with nuclear power plants. In this plan, some policy actions are proposed for a gradual implementation. Policy actions such as special fees for those driving internal combustion engine vehicles, free parking for zero-emission vehicles or even a subsidized car replacement plan. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Introduction: The United Kingdom (UK) has one of the highest prevalence of asthma in the world, which represents a significant economic and societal burden. Reduced ventilation resulting from increased energy efficiency measures acts as a modifier for mould contamination and risk of allergic diseases. To our knowledge no previous study has combined detailed asset management property and health data together to assess the impact of household energy efficiency (using the UK Government's Standard Assessment Procedure) on asthma outcomes in an adult population residing in social housing. Methods: Postal questionnaires were sent to 3867 social housing properties to collect demographic, health and environmental information on all occupants. Detailed property data, residency periods, indices of multiple deprivation (IMD) and household energy efficiency ratings were also investigated. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and confidence intervals while allowing for clustering of individuals coming from the same location. Results: Eighteen percent of our target social housing population were recruited into our study. Adults had a mean age of 59 (SD +/- 17.3) years and there was a higher percentage of female (59%) and single occupancy (58%) respondents. Housing demographic characteristics were representative of the target homes. A unit increase in household Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) rating was associated with a 2% increased risk of current asthma, with the greatest risk in homes with SAP >71. We assessed exposure to mould and found that the presence of a mouldy/musty odour was associated with a two-fold increased risk of asthma (OR 2.2 95%; CI 1.3-3.8). A unit increase in SAP led to a 4-5% reduction in the risk of visible mould growth and a mouldy/musty odour. Discussion: In contrast to previous research, we report that residing in energy efficient homes may increase the risk of adult asthma. We report that mould contamination increased the risk of asthma, which is in agreement with existing knowledge. Exposure to mould contamination could not fully explain the association between increased energy efficiency and asthma. Our findings may be explained by increased energy efficiency combined with the provision of inadequate heating, ventilation, and increased concentrations of other biological, chemical and physical contaminants. This is likely to be modified by a complex interaction between occupant behaviours and changes to,the built environment. Our findings may also be confounded by our response rate, demographic and behavioural differences between those residing in low versus high energy efficient homes, and use of self-reported exposures and outcomes. Conclusion: Energy efficiency may increase the risk of current adult asthma in a population residing in social housing. This association was not significantly modified by the presence of visible mould growth, although further research is needed to investigate the interaction between other demographic and housing characteristic risk factors, especially the impact of fuel poverty on indoor exposures and health outcomes. Study implications: A multidisciplinary approach is required to assess the interaction between energy efficiency measures and fuel poverty behaviours on health outcomes prior to the delivery of physical interventions aimed at improving the built environment. Policy incentives are required to address fuel poverty issues alongside measures to achieve SAP ratings of 71 or greater, which must be delivered with the provision of adequate heating and ventilation strategies to minimise indoor dampness. Changes in the built environment without changes in behaviour of domicile residents may lead to negative health outcomes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Urban population growth is leading to growing concerns about land use change, green infrastructure, and the loss of beneficial ecosystem services. Human and environmental health is supported by services such as climate regulation, air filtration, and flood mitigation. However, maintaining these services within cities requires the preservation and equitable distribution of green infrastructure near where people live. Sydney, Australia, where the population is expected to grow from 4.3 million to 5.6 million by 2031, is undergoing an urban transformation. This study investigates the spatial distribution of green infrastructure within Sydney to determine how patterns of green infrastructure vary according to land use, residential density, and socio-economic variation. More than half of urban Sydney is comprised of residential land use, representing the single largest contribution to Sydney's green infrastructure. Two types of green infrastructure are examined in this study, public green space represented by parkland area and tree canopy cover and private green space represented by residential area and tree canopy cover. Results show that with greater dwelling density, both types of green infrastructure decrease. Availability of private versus public green infrastructure, however, differs according to socio-economic advantage. Suburbs of higher socio-economic advantage have significantly more private green cover, but slightly less public green cover than suburbs of greater disadvantage. These findings highlight that urban densification can lead to a general loss of two important reservoirs of urban green infrastructure (public parkland and residential tree cover). Disadvantaged communities may have a greater reliance on public green infrastructure in the form of parkland due to a lack of private residential tree cover. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

      "The occurrence, fate and environmental impact of 30 pharmaceuticals including sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, macrolides, dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors, b-blockers, antiepileptics, lipid regulators, and stimulants were studied in two municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in Wuxi City, East China. A total of 23 pharmaceuticals were detected in wastewater samples, with a maximum concentration of 16.1 mg L-1 (caffeine) in the influent and 615.5 ng L-1 (azithromycin) in the effluent; 19 pharmaceuticals were detected in sludge samples at concentrations up to 12.13 mg kg(-1), with ofloxacin, azithromycin and norfloxacin being the predominant species. Mass balance analysis showed that biodegradation primarily accounted for the removal of sulfonamides, most of the macrolides, and other miscellaneous pharmaceuticals, while adsorption onto the sludge was the primary removal pathway for fluoroquinolones, tetracylines, and azithromycin during biological treatment. The total mass loads of target pharmaceuticals per capita in the two WWTPs were in the ranges of 2681.84333.3, 248.0-416.6 and 214.6-374.5 mg per day per inhabitant in the influent, effluent and dewatered sludge, respectively. The upgraded Plant A adopting the combined anaerobic/anoxic/oxic and moving bed biofilm process exhibited a much higher removal of target pharmaceuticals than the conventional Plant B adopting the C-Orbal oxidation ditch process. The concentration levels of sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin in the effluent, ofloxacin in the sludge, and the mixture of all target pharmaceuticals in both effluent and sludge posed a high risk to algae in aquatic environments.\n",

      "Improving the energy efficiency of the thermal conditioning of buildings is an international priority. Along this line, there have been major advances in the insulation of enclosures and the equipping of facilities. The need for building ventilation has an enormous impact on the environmental energy consumption evaluation. Filtration resulting from imperfections in enclosures and partitions always accompanies narrow ventilation flow, increasing the unabated consumption of energy. The present research study establishes an evaluation procedure for this excess energy consumption via an experimental study carried out in various buildings located in the north and central part of Spain. The procedure, commonly called the Blower Door Test, is based on standards EN 13829 and ISO 9972.

      "After 2020, all new buildings in Europe must be built as \"nearly zero-energy buildings\" (NZEB). For residential and certain commercial building types, significant experience in both research and practice is already available for such ambitious building standards. However, for industrial buildings, such as warehouses and production buildings, NZEB is still a new field. To date findings for residential and office buildings are often used to define standards for the entire building sector. However, industrial buildings have completely different thermal behavior due to their different building shapes, materials, interior temperatures, usage times and internal gains from processes and machines. Therefore, new concepts are required for nearly zero-energy industrial buildings. In this research, such concepts were developed based on large parametric studies simulating more than 1800 different variations in a building simulation model coupled with a 3D transient finite difference ground model and an air-flow network simulation. To gain the required input data for the air infiltration simulation, extensive leakage measurements in a therefore built air-tightness test stand were conducted. According to the EU directive stipulating the NZEB standard, NZEBs have to be cost-optimal. Thus, the focus of this work was on developing cost-optimal solutions to meet the NZEB standard. The results are building concepts for warehouses and production buildings that have 50-75% lower heat energy demand than current (2015) building standards in Germany. These heat energy savings are primarily achieved by increased air tightness, decreased thermal bridges, optimized floor slab insulation and solar optimization. Significantly increased insulation thicknesses are only cost-effective for industrial buildings with low internal gains but relatively high interior temperatures. Previous standards almost exclusively concentrated on increasing the thermal insulation, while the other parameters were often neglected. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "By 2050, up to 75% of people globally will live in cities. Despite the potential ramifications of this urbanization for ecosystem services (ES), and the importance of locally produced ES for the health and wellbeing of urban residents, syntheses addressing the underlying ecology of ES provision rarely include urban areas. Here, I conduct a quantitative review of urban ES studies in the ecological literature, synthesizing trends across the discipline. I also quantify the extent to which this work considers the organisms and ecosystem components responsible for ES provision using two approaches: assessment of biodiversity-ES relationships, and an adaptation of the service provider concept. The majority of urban ES studies were conducted in western, developed countries, and typically assessed a single service in a single city - largely ignoring ES synergies and tradeoffs, and cross-city comparisons. While several different ES are studied in urban ecosystems, the field is dominated by weather and climate-related regulating services, with assessments of cultural services particularly lacking. Most studies described a habitat type as the service provider; however, studies that considered the biodiversity-ES relationship were more likely to identify a specific functional group, community, or population as the key provider of an ES. The biodiversity-ES relationship itself was most frequently characterized as dependent on the composition of species, functional traits, or structures, rather than correlated with the magnitude of any specific biodiversity metric. While the study of ES in urban ecosystems is increasing, there exists considerable room for further research. Future studies would benefit by expanding the number and categories of ES assessed within and across cities, as well as broadening the geographical scope of urban ES research. Biodiversity-ES assessments in urban ecosystems would also benefit from an expansion of the biodiversity types considered, particularly regarding non-species based approaches, and consideration of non-native and invasive species.\n",

      "Atmospheric fine particles (diameter < 1 mu m) attract a growing global health concern and have increased in urban areas that have a strong link to nucleation, traffic emissions, and industrial emissions. To reveal the characteristics of fine particles in an industrial city of a developing country, two-year measurements of particle number size distribution (15.1 nm-661 nm), meteorological parameters, and trace gases were made in the city of Wuhan located in central China from June 2012 to May 2014. The annual average particle number concentrations in the nucleation mode (15.1 nm-30 nm), Aitken mode (30 nm-100 nm), and accumulation mode (100 nm-661 nm) reached 4923 cm(-3), 12193 cm(-3) and 4801 cm(-3), respectively. Based on Pearson coefficients between particle number concentrations and meteorological parameters, precipitation and temperature both had significantly negative relationships with particle number concentrations, whereas atmospheric pressure was positively correlated with the particle number concentrations. The diurnal variation of number concentration in nucleation mode particles correlated closely with photochemical processes in all four seasons. At the same time, distinct growth of particles from nucleation mode to Aitken mode was only found in spring, summer, and autumn. The two peaks of Aitken mode and accumulation mode particles in morning and evening corresponded obviously to traffic exhaust emissions peaks. A phenomenon of \"repeated, short-lived\" nucleation events have been created to explain the durability of high particle concentrations, which was instigated by exogenous pollutants, during winter in a case analysis of Wuhan. Measurements of hourly trace gases and segmental meteorological factors were applied as proxies for complex chemical reactions and dense industrial activities. The results of this study offer reasonable estimations of particle impacts and provide references for emissions control strategies in industrial cities of developing countries.\n",

      "Technological advances are bringing connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to the ever-evolving transportation system. Anticipating public acceptance and adoption of these technologies is important. A recent internet-based survey polled 347 Austinites to understand their opinions on smart-car technologies and strategies. Results indicate that respondents perceive fewer crashes to be the primary benefit of autonomous vehicles (AVs), with equipment failure being their top concern. Their average willingness to pay (WTP) for adding full (Level 4) automation ($7253) appears to be much higher than that for adding partial (Level 3) automation ($3300) to their current vehicles. Ordered probit and other model specifications estimate the impact of demographics, built-environment variables, and travel characteristics on Austinites' WTP for adding various automation technologies and connectivity to their current and coming vehicles. It also estimates adoption rates of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) under different pricing scenarios ($1, $2, and $3 per mile), choice dependence on friends' and neighbors' adoption rates, and home-location decisions after AVs and SAVs become a common mode of transport. Higher-income, technology-savvy males, who live in urban areas, and those who have experienced more crashes have a greater interest in and higher WTP for the new technologies, with less dependence on others' adoption rates. Such behavioral models are useful to simulate long-term adoption of CAV technologies under different vehicle pricing and demographic scenarios. These results can be used to develop smarter transportation systems for more efficient and sustainable travel. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Background: Socioeconomic disparities in active transport have been documented in household travel surveys. However, active transport in these studies was operationalized with self-reported measures, which poorly approximate physical activity. Unfortunately, objective accelerometer data are very expensive to obtain in large-scale travel studies. Purpose: To benefit from a large sample and objective physical activity data, this study linked a cross-sectional household travel survey with accelerometer data from a small sample to investigate the association between socioeconomic disadvantage and the daily level of transport-related moderate-to vigorous physical activity (T-MVPA) in an adult population (35-83 years). Methods: Accelerometer data for participants' trips over 7 days from the RECORD GPS Study (7138 trips, 229 participants) were combined with information on participants' trips over 1 day from the Global Transport Survey (Enquete Globale Transport, EGT) (82084 trips, 21332 participants). Trip-level T-MVPA data from the RECORD sample were used to train a random forests prediction model, enabling the prediction of T-MVPA for each participant's trip from EGT. The associations between socioeconomic indicators and daily T-MVPA were analyzed with negative binomial regression models. Results: An average time of 18.9 min (95% confidence interval: 18.6-19.2) of T-MVPA was found for these 35-83 year old adults. The education level had a positive association with T-MVPA. Household income had a negative association with T-MVPA, especially for those people without a motorized vehicle. Conclusions: This study developed a methodology exporting precise sensor-based knowledge to a large survey sample to shed light on population-level socioeconomic disparities in transport-related physical activity.

      "Background: Cycle accidents are a common cause of physical injury in children and adolescents. Education is one strategy to reduce cycle-related injuries. In the UK, some children undertake National Cycle Proficiency Scheme [NCPS] training (now known as Bikeability) in their final years of primary school. It aims to promote cycling and safe cycling behaviours but there has been little scientific evaluation of its effectiveness. Methods: The sample (n = 5415) were participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children who reported whether or not they had received NCPS training. Outcomes were self-reported at 14 and 16 years: cycling to school, ownership of cycle helmet, use of cycle helmet and high-visibility clothing on last cycle, and involvement in a cycle accident. An additional outcome, hospital admittance due to a cycle accident from 11 to 16 years, was also included for a subsample (n = 2222) who have been linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data. Results: Approximately 40 % of the sample had received NCPS training. Trained children were more likely to cycle to school and to own a cycle helmet at both 14 and 16 years, to have worn a helmet on their last cycle at age 14, and to have worn high-visibility clothing at age 16, than those who had not attended a course. NCPS training was not associated with self-reported involvement in a cycle accident, and only six of those with HES data had been admitted to hospital due to a cycle accident. Irrespective of training, results indicate very low use of high-visibility clothing, very few girls cycling as part of their school commute, and less than half of helmet owners wearing one on their last cycle. Conclusions: Our results suggest cycle training courses for children can have benefits that persist into adolescence. However, the low use of cycle helmets, very low use of high-visibility clothing, and low levels of cycling to school for girls, indicate the further potential for interventions to encourage cycling, and safe cycling behaviours, in young people.\n",

      "This paper presents an overview of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in Beijing City. Beijing, the capital of China, has a land area of approximately 1368.32 km(2) with an urban population of about 13.33 million in 2006. Over the past three decades, MSW generation in Beijing City has increased tremendously from 1.04 million tons in 1978 to 4.134 million tons in 2006. The average generation rate of MSW in 2006 was 0.85 kg/capita/day. Food waste comprised 63.39%, followed by paper (11.07%), plastics (12.7%) and dust (5.78%). While all other wastes including tiles, textiles, glass. metals and wood accounted for less than 3%. Currently, 90% of MSW generated in Beijing is landfilled, 8% is incinerated and 2% is composted. Source separation collection, as a waste reduction method, has been carried out in a total of 2255 demonstration residential and commercial areas (covering about 4.7 million people) up to the end of 2007. Demonstration districts should be promoted over a wider range instead of demonstration communities. The capacity of transfer stations and treatment plants is an urgent problem as these sites are seriously overloaded. These problems should first be solved by constructing more sites and converting to new treatment technologies. Improvements in legislation, public education and the management of waste pickers are problematic issues which need to be addressed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "As waste generation increases with increasing population, regulations become stricter to control and mitigate environmental emissions of substances, e.g. heavy metals such as zinc and copper. Recovering these resources from wastes is the key interest of industries. The objective of this paper is the sustain ability and feasibility evaluations of zinc recovery from waste streams. Sustainability and feasibility of a resource recovery strategy from wastes in a circular economy are governed by avoided environmental impacts and cost-effective transformation of an environmental contaminant into a valuable resource, e.g. as a coproduct by making use of an existing infrastructure as much as possible. This study, for the first time, gives a comprehensive overview of secondary sources and processes of recovering zinc, its stock analysis by country, regional and global divisions by a Sankey diagram, policies to regulate zinc emissions and avoided environmental impacts by zinc recovery. Two representative cases are further investigated for economic feasibility analysis of zinc recovery from (1) steelmaking dust and (2) municipal solid waste (MSW). The amount and value of zinc that can be generated from dust emitted from various steelmaking technologies are estimated. Additional revenues for the steelmaking industrial sector (with electric arc furnace), at the plant, national (UK), regional (EU) and global levels are 11, 12, 169 and 1670 million tonne/y, or 19-143, 20-157, 287-2203 and 2834-21740 million (sic)/y, respectively. The second case study entails an integrated mechanical biological treatment (MBT) system of MSW consisting of metal recovery technologies, anaerobic digestion, refuse derived fuel (RDF) incineration and combined heat and power (CHP) generation. An effective economic value analysis methodology has been adopted to analyse the techno-economic feasibility of the integrated MBT system. The value analysis shows that an additional economic margin of 500 can be generated from the recovery of 1 t of zinc in the integrated MBT system enhancing its overall economic margin by 9%.

      "The combination of climate change and urbanization projected to occur until 2050 poses new challenges for land-use planning, not least in terms of reducing urban vulnerability to hazards from projected increases in the frequency and intensity of climate extremes. Interest in investments in green infrastructure (interconnected systems of parks, wetlands, gardens and other green spaces), as well as in restoration of urban ecosystems as part of such adaptation strategies, is growing worldwide. Previous research has highlighted the insurance value of ecosystems in securing the supply of ecosystem services in the face of disturbance and change, yet this literature neglects urban areas even though urban populations are often highly vulnerable. We revisit the insurance value literature to examine the applicability of the concept in urban contexts, illustrating it with two case studies: watersheds providing drinking water for residents of Vancouver, Canada; and private gardens ensuring connectedness between other parts of urban green infrastructure in London, UK. Our research supports the notion that investments in green infrastructure can enhance insurance value, reducing vulnerability and the costs of adaptation to climate change and other environmental change. Although we recommend that urban authorities consider the insurance value of ecosystems in their decision-making matrix, we advise caution in relying upon monetary evaluations of insurance value. We conclude by identifying actions and management strategies oriented to maintain or enhance the insurance value of urban ecosystems. Ecosystems that are themselves resilient to external disturbances are better able to provide insurance for broader social-ecological systems.\n",

      "Enhanced dissemination of information regarding energy saving and climate change targeted toward property owners is considered to be an important strategy in order to reach the Swedish national target of energy efficiency in the building sector by 2050. Here the municipality energy advisors and the national register for energy performance certificates can facilitate the mitigation of energy use in the building stock. So far few studies have focused on the practical road map to the national target of energy use on the city/district level and to the communication aspects with stakeholders in the creation of energy city models.In this paper a city energy model is developed based on the requests and need for visualization from a group of energy advisors. Six different scenarios are studied in order to analyze the possibility of reaching the energy targets specified by the government in the town of Kiruna. The results show that: (1) it is possible to automatically create city energy models using extract, transform and load tools based on spatial and non-spatial data from national registers and databases; (2) city energy models improve the understanding of energy use in buildings and can therefore be a valuable tool for energy advisors, real estate companies and urban planners. The case study of Kiruna showed that the proposed energy saving measures in the energy performance certificates need to be implemented and new buildings in the urban transformation must be of high energy standard in order to reach the national target in Kiruna.

      "In the present study, energy and exergy analyses are presented for the whole process of space heating in buildings. This study is based on a pre-design analysis tool, which has been produced during ongoing work for the International Energy Agency (IEA) formed within the Energy Conservation in Buildings and Community Systems Programme (ECBCSP) Annex 37. Throughout this paper, in all of the calculations such as heat losses and gains were taken according to Turkish Standards Institution TSE, which is in accordance with the European Standard TS EN ISO 13789. In the analysis, heating load is taken account but cooling load is neglected and the calculations presented here are done using steady state conditions. The analysis is applied to an office in Izmir with a volume of 720 m(3) and a net floor area of 240 m(2) as an example of application. Indoor and exterior air temperatures are 20 degrees C and 0 degrees C, respectively. It is assumed that the office is heated by a liquid natural gas (LNG) fired conventional boiler, an LNG condensing boiler and an external air-air heat pump. With this study, energy and exergy flows are investigated. Energy and exergy losses in the whole system are quantified and illustrated. The highest efficiency values in terms of energy and exergy were found to be 80.9% for external air-air heat pump and 8.69% for LNG condensing boiler, respectively. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

      "The aim of this paper is to develop an approach and tools for cross-sectoral regional industrial GHG and energy policies. These policies can be conducted at different levels of society. To achieve real results in energy efficiency improvements and in GHG reductions, the policies must be focused on the correct levels in society. In Finland, the province level seems to be a reasonable level for a policy targeted at industry. This paper proposes a category for the ways industry uses energy: building energy users, major users of electricity for process/production, major users of heat for process/production and direct combustion users. This approach gives opportunities for developing regional cooperation among different industries. The approach is also important between industries and society, so that there are integrated solutions which e.g. utilise district heating and biofuel potentials. The individual technologies like electric motors, pumps, fans, heat recovery equipment and boilers do not seem to have any significant potentials for improvements in energy efficiency by the EU target year 2020. However, there are opportunities but they are at system levels: how effectively the individual technologies are applied as a part of industrial systems. This fact supports the idea of energy use categorising. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Delhi generates about 8360 tons of municipal solid waste per day, and there is low compliance to rules regarding waste management. The objective of this paper was to understand the situation in Delhi with respect to the segregation, storage, collection, and disposal of household waste, and to assess the knowledge of the residents of Delhi, and their willingness to engage in solid-waste management. A stratified random sample, comprising 3047 respondents, was chosen for a questionnaire survey, covering all municipalities of Delhi, with socio-economic classification as the stratifying variable. Survey results indicate that 60% of residents do not know the difference between biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste, and only 2% of them segregate waste. Fifty-eight percent of respondents reported that the waste collector mixes the segregated waste, 97% of respondents reported that they sold items to an itinerant waste buyer, and 87% of households are covered by doorstep waste collection services. Abstract knowledge (general knowledge about waste management) is seen to have a significant correlation with willingness to engage in waste management. Differences between the socio-economic groups indicate that the highest (most educated and wealthy), as well as the lowest socio-economic category (least educated and poor), older age-groups, and women, have greater abstract knowledge. Socio-economic categories having higher abstract knowledge can be active participants in decentralized models of waste management.\n",

      "The Mediterranean basin is a global hotspot of biological diversity and the most rich biodiversity region in Europe. Nevertheless, climate-driven habitat loss is one of the most serious concerns for biodiversity conservation in this region. We assess Mediterranean habitat loss and conversion into arid habitat under scenarios of climate change and evaluate protected areas, including Natura 2000 sites, which will be affected by these changes. We mapped shifts of Mediterranean and arid domains using four bias corrected simulations from Regional Climate Models for two emission scenarios over this century, dis-aggregated to a 1 km grid size. Our results indicate that by the end of the century the Euro-Mediterranean domain is projected to shift into other climatic domains by an area equivalent to 53 -121% of its current size. However it is projected to lose 11-25% of its current extent, which represents an area close to the size of Greece and Portugal combined. The loss is entirely due to shifts of the arid domain. Additionally, our results indicate that the extent of the arid domain is projected to increase by 228-450% of its current size in the European region. The shrinking of the current Euro-Mediterranean domain is projected to affect 15-23% of the Mediterranean Natura 2000 sites, and the loss in these sites is projected at 13-30% of its current area. Loss is projected to occur in central and southern areas of the Iberian Peninsula, southern Italy and the island of Sicily, south-eastern Greece, Cyprus, Malta and central Turkey. Computed changes in projected climatic parameters indicate that current areas of the Euro-Mediterranean domain will be hotter and drier. Temperature increase and precipitation decrease are projected to be more marked in the summer half of the year. As early as in the 2020s annual temperature is projected to increase by 0.9-1.4 degrees C with respect to the present reference climate, reaching an increase of 2.2-3.6 degrees C by the end of the century. By this period, summer precipitation is projected to decrease by 24-46% and annual precipitation by 14-23%. We provide insight into several aspects of adaptation and management of Mediterranean protected areas. A proactive approach taking into consideration landscape connectivity and the concomitant threats triggered by climate change is a priority. Proactive adaptation and management promoting investments in Green Infrastructure and a denser network of interconnected protected areas are necessary instruments for preserving Mediterranean biodiversity from the threats of habitat loss.

      "As part of sustainable urban planning; the potential of public transportation modes has been studied to reduce CO2 emissions and energy consumption and to increase roadway safety. Increasing public transportation ridership shares compared to drive alone transportation mode would therefore be a giant step toward more environmentally friendly and stress-free cities, and so this study aims to propose possible public transportation policies to be adopted by policy makers or urban planners. Although public transportation is one of the sub-sections of urban planning, it has a wide variety of aspects that affect local societies and the environment, so a system dynamics approach is used to model and simulate the most realistic and practical CO2 mitigation scenarios for U.S. cities by adopting public transportation policies for future years. Based on historical data and applicable model validation processes, the behavior of the U.S. commuters' transportation mode choice and the potential of transit transportation to mitigate CO2 emissions are both forecasted for future-years up to 2050 under several possible policy scenarios. The results indicate that, in order to decrease fuel consumption and CO2 emission trends, marginal and ambitious scenarios should be implemented. For instance, increasing public transportation ridership by 9% has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions by 766,000 tonnes annually in 2050, whereas a 25% increase in ridership could potentially reduce cumulative CO2 emissions by 61.3 million tonnes.

      "Natural gas vehicles offer the benefits of reducing oil use, CO2 emissions and air pollutants. Promoting the use of natural gas vehicles is considered as one of the most important strategies towards sustainable transportation. China made remarkable progress in promoting natural gas vehicles over recent years, and its 4.6 million natural gas vehicles in 2014 represented the world's largest natural gas vehicle fleet. In this paper, the development of natural gas vehicles in China is reviewed based on a triple-perspective (Fuel Vehicle-Infrastructure) technical-economical framework. The review indicates that (a) pricing of vehicle use Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is essential in determining natural gas vehicle development. A pricing principle similar to the fixed CNG/gasoline price ratio (0.75:1) should be applied to LNG/diesel price ratio; (b) for CNG passenger vehicles, the modified CNG vehicles, with (sic)3000-5000 additional cost, is more attractive to consumers than originally manufactured CNG vehicles, with about (sic)10,000 additional cost. Vehicle retrofit should be permitted by the government with the precondition that retrofit standards are strictly enforced; (c) for CNG/LNG transit buses, the deployment is strongly affected by local government's preference. In regions with sufficient natural gas supply, the government should prioritize the deployment of CNG/LNG transit buses rather than other technologies; (d) for LNG commercial vehicles, with (sic)60,000-80,000 higher cost than their counterpart diesel vehicles, financial incentive is critical for their development. China's current vehicle subsidy scheme should be extended to cover LNG commercial vehicles; (e) regarding refueling infrastructures, interference with urban land-use planning and long-time administrative approval are the major barriers. Local governments should launch dedicated plans and strategies to support the further deployment of CNG/LNG refueling infrastructures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "According to EU's Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), all new buildings shall be nearly Zero Energy Buildings (ZEB) from 2018/2020. How the ZEB requirement is defined has large implications for the choice of energy technology when considering both cost and environmental issues. This paper presents a methodology for determining ZEB buildings' cost optimal energy system design seen from the building owner's perspective. The added value of this work is the inclusion of peak load tariffs and feed-in tariffs, the facilitation of load shifting by use of a thermal storage, along with the integrated optimisation of the investment and operation of the energy technologies. The model allows for detailed understanding of the hourly operation of the building, and how the ZEB interacts with the electricity grid through the characteristics of its net electric load profile. The modelling framework can be adapted to fit individual countries' ZEB definitions. The findings are important for policy makers as they identify how subsidies and EPBD's regulations influence the preferred energy technology choice, which subsequently determines its grid interaction. A case study of a Norwegian school building shows that the heat technology is altered from HP to bio boiler when the ZEB requirement is applied. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "This review presents an overview with critical analysis of the technical applicability of biological treatments for landfill leachate. A particular focus is given to activated sludge (AS), sequencing batch reactors (SBR), aerated lagoons (AL), and upflow anaerobic sludge blankets (UASB). Their advantages and limitations in application are evaluated. Selected information is presented such as pH, hydraulic retention time (HRT), organic loading rate (OLR), characteristics of leachate and treatment performance. It is evident from the literature survey of 188 papers (1976-2010) that none of the individual biological treatments presented is universally applicable for removing recalcitrant contaminants from leachate. Among the biological treatments reviewed, AS, SBR and UASB are the most frequently applied. These treatments are effective not only to remove over 90% of COD with a concentration ranging from 3500-26 000 mg L(-1), but also to achieve 80% of NH(3)-N removal with a concentration ranging from 100-1000 mg L(-1). A combination of physico-chemical and biological treatment into an integrated process is effective for leachate treatment. Almost complete removal of COD and NH(3)-N was reported for combined reverse osmosis (RO) and UASB with an initial COD concentration of 35 000 mg L(-1) and NH(3)-N concentration of 1600 mg L(-1). Integrated Fenton's oxidation and AS could achieve about 98% and 99% of COD and NH(3)-N removal, respectively, with initial COD and NH(3)-N concentrations of 7000 mg L(-1) and 1800 mg L(-1). Overall, the selection of the most suitable treatment for leachate depends on its characteristics, technical applicability and potential constraints, effluent limit required, cost-effectiveness, regulatory requirements and long-term environmental impacts.\n",

      "The Energy Performance of Buildings Directives (EPBDs) are political initiatives taken by the European Union to tackle the problems of climate change and security of energy supply. One of the key measures of these directives is the use of Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) to model the energy performance of housing. This research investigates whether the current calculation methodologies in use for the generation of EPCs in the Mediterranean are appropriate. The analysis was carried out by comparative testing using different national methodologies from Cyprus, Italy, Malta and Spain on four test case study dwellings. The test results were validated against the output from dynamic simulation software and against monitored temperature and energy data from the test case properties. Considerable differences in the outputs from the various national methodologies currently in use were found. It was concluded that several of the EPC calculation methodologies have not been calibrated against the energy profile representative of the national or regional building stock; accurate definition of the operating parameters for the heating and cooling system is particularly significant if a more precise prediction of the energy performance of the dwelling is required; and the underlying assumptions made by the national application of the EN ISO 13790 standard for the calculation of the energy use for space heating and cooling have a greater influence on the outputs from the certification methodology than the choice of calculation method. It is quite clear that calibration of the EPC methodology is essential for the certificates to provide an effective means of achieving the aims of the EPBD. However, at a conceptual level, the results from this research have also shown that the mild Mediterranean climate with its inherently low energy demand for residential space heating and cooling could justify a different regional approach to tackle the EPBD goals of reduction in carbon emissions and dependency on imported fuels.

      "Momentum has been building for an EU-wide approach to energy policy in which energy end-use efficiency is regarded as one of the main planks. Member States are already obliged to plan for the achievement of energy savings targets in respect of the period 2008-2016 and they now face additional economy-wide targets for 2020. Efficiency investments are widely regarded as capable of improving industrial competitiveness, security of energy supply and the abatement of greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, the design of policy packages may involve trade-offs between these objectives. The challenge for energy modellers is to quantify future energy savings associated with combinations of efficiency measures. This paper draws on the international experience in energy modelling and tracks recent progress that has been made towards a harmonised European framework for verification of savings. It points to the significant development work that remains to be done, particularly to enable an increased reliance on bottom-up evaluation methods. One significant gap in our knowledge relates to the required adjustment of technical savings due to behavioural factors such as rebound effects. The paper uses one country (Ireland) as a case study to demonstrate how a framework is being developed to respond to these new requirements. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) of Santa Clara County, California, recently developed a bus rapid transit (BRT) strategic plan to establish a framework for BRT implementation, provide guidance on policy issues, and serve as a vehicle for community interaction. A multiphased evaluation process was applied to identify the most feasible near-term BRT corridors within the county, develop operating plans and infrastructure strategies, and select the preferred BRT operating and infrastructure strategies. Three corridors were prioritized for near-term BRT. The preferred operating strategy was forecast to generate 25,000 more daily riders in 2030 than the no-project scenario and showed promise to improve mobility along key arterials around San Jose, California. The BRT strategic plan was adopted by the VTA board of directors in mid-2009. VTA is moving forward with engineering and desk work on the three near-term corridors. This paper discusses the approach and processes adopted in the strategic plan that moved the BRT discussion forward. Cities in a similar incipient stage of BRT planning can heed key lessons learned to facilitate their own activities: establishing a coherent BRT vision and development process internally before reaching out to stakeholders, involving operations staff early in the development process to foster buy-in, holding frank discussions on maintaining local overlay service, and applying a specific process to develop a signature and unique BRT brand and service.\n",

      "Objective: This study aims to investigate the association between mode of transportation to work and dyslipidaemia. Methods: During the period between January and February 2006, telephone interviews were conducted with 2506 randomly selected urban residents aged 18 years or older in the 8 districts of Beijing, using a multiple stratified random sampling technique. Of the selected individuals, 1024 (40.86%) members of the workforce were subsequently tested for biomarkers (ie, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)). Multiple logistic regression modelling was used, adjusted for potential confounders. Results: The probability of dyslipidaemia in workers who travel to work by bus, car or taxi is higher than that of workers who walk to work, with prevalence odds ratios (PORs) of 1.99 (95% CI 1.33 to 2.97) and 2.21 ( 95% CI 1.28 to 3.84), respectively. There is no significant difference in the risk of experiencing dyslipidaemia when workers who ride bicycles are compared with those who walk to work (POR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.78). Conclusions: These findings indicate that modes of transportation to work are significantly associated with the prevalence of dyslipidaemia. Prevention education should be emphasised among higher-risk people who usually go to work by car, bus or taxi.\n",

      "Energy efficiency upgrades of privately owned homes like adding to the insulation layers in the walls, roof or floor, or replacing windows with more efficiently insulated versions can contribute significantly to reducing the energy impact of the building sector and thus also the CO2 footprint of a household. However, even in countries like Norway that have a rather high rate of renovation, energy upgrades are not always integrated into such a refurbishment project. This study tests which structural and internal psychological barriers hinder and which drivers foster decision-making to implement such measures, once a renovation project is planned. With a theoretical background in stage-based models of decision-making 24 barriers and drivers were tested for their specific effect in the stages of decision-making. The four stages of decision-making assumed in this study were (1) \"not being in a decision mode,\" (2) \"deciding what to do,\" (3) \"deciding how to do it,\" and (4) \"planning implementation.\" Based on an online survey of 3787 Norwegian households, it was found that the most important barriers toward deciding to implement energy efficiency upgrades were not owning the dwelling and feeling the right time had not come yet. The most important drivers of starting to decide were higher expected comfort levels, better expected living conditions, and an expected reduction of energy costs. For the transition from deciding what to do to how to do it, not managing to make a decision and feeling the right point in time has not come yet were the strongest barriers, easily accessible information and an expected reduction of energy costs were the most important drivers. The final transition from deciding how to do the upgrades to planning implementation was driven by expecting a payoff within a reasonable time frame and higher expected comfort levels; the most important barriers were time demands for supervising contractors and-again-a feeling that the right point in time has not come yet. Implications for policy-making and marketing are discussed.\n",

By July 2009 it was back to close to A U$1.20/litre. Despite the volatility, some long-term forecasters suggest a price as high as AU$8/litre in 2020 is not beyond the realms of reality. Despite the increases and drops in retail in petrol prices over the last three years, there is a sense of optimism in some camps that prices will rise when the global financial crisis is over, and that finally we will have pricing signals to encourage earlier investment in substitutes that include public transport, more fuel efficient cars as well as lower polluting vehicles.

      "To improve quality of life as well as the adaptive capacity in the city of Rotterdam over the past 15 years there has been a lot of focus on improving green infrastructure and finding new ways for integrated planning. As many cities face similar challenges they are looking for novel approaches in urban ecosystem governance. The Rotterdam case can be an interesting example but can also reveal new questions to be researched.Before local policies and projects where developed a regional and urban green blue vision of how to improve overall quality of life using green infrastructure were developed. This provided policy frameworks for politicians, policymakers and other actors. Later on the same was done with Urban Waterplan 2, using the Rotterdam Watercity 2030 vision document as a basis. This vision was the result of a stakeholder based planning process which was made for the International Architecture Biennale 2005. Within these frameworks many interesting projects have been built and tested in the city and city region; ranging from a) a roof park over a railway yard to connect neighbourhoods to the waterfront, to b) water squares and c) digging new waterways with connected walking and biking routes. To go from projects to an overall implementation at city level required tools and approaches for better decision making. For the 'Dakpark' project as well as for the Zomerhofkwartier, the first climate proof neighbourhood in the city, stakeholder sessions were held and plans were drawn together with urban planners and landscape architects. To feed these processes even better and to know what would be an optimal solution for certain challenges, city data were studied and linked to scalable GIS mapping in the 'smart city planner'. This tool gives the decision maker the possibility to quickly have an overview of an area and can be used in a stakeholder process to provide relevant additional information and to define joint projects. The tool makes it possible to do this for all 90 neighbourhoods in the city.Overall the urban ecosystem governance in the city of Rotterdam has - with trial and error- lead to a series of innovative projects. The next steps are acceleration and scaling up to city and regional level. Valuing the crucial role of green blue infrastructure for several aspects of the quality of life in cities are paramount.

      "Adoption of electric vehicles by transport companies remains limited although major European cities should reach CO2-free city logistics by 2030. This paper explores therefore the vehicle choice behaviour of transport companies through a conjoint-based choice analysis. The results showed that the benefits of battery electric vehicles are less valued than their disadvantages. However, a majority of respondents agrees that authorities should encourage the use of battery electric vehicles. Based on the preferences of transporters, we conclude that the most important measures are to develop a larger charging infrastructure and implement financial incentives through subsidies or tax exemption.

      "Emission factors for elemental metals were determined from several heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDV) of 1998-2007 vintage, operating with advanced PM and/or NOX emissions control retrofits on a heavy-duty chassis dynamometer, under steady state cruise, transient, and idle conditions. The emission control retrofits included diesel particulate filters (DPF): catalyzed and uncatalyzed, passive and active prototype vanadium- or zeolite-based selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems, and a catalyzed DPF fitted on a hybrid diesel electric drive vehicle. The prototype SCR systems in combination with DPF retrofits are of particular interest because they represent the expected emissions controls for compliance with PM and NOX regulations in 2010. PM samples from a full-exhaust dilution tunnel were collected on bulk filters, and on a Personal Cascade Impactor Sampler (PCIS) for total and water-soluble elemental analysis. All the DPFs significantly reduced emissions of total trace elements (>85% and >95% for cruise and for the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS), respectively). However, we observed differences in the post-retrofit metals emissions due to driving cycle effects (i.e., exhaust temperature) and type of retrofit. In general, the metals emissions over cruise conditions (which leads to higher exhaust temperatures) were substantially different from the emissions over a transient cycle or while idling. For instance, during cruise, we observed higher levels of platinum (1.1 +/- 0.6-4.2 +/- 3.6 ng km(-1)) for most of the retrofit-equipped vehicle tests compared to the baseline configuration (0.3 +/- 0.1 ng km(-1)). The vanadium-based DPF + SCR vehicle during cruise operation exhibited emissions of vanadium (562 +/- 265 ng km(-1)) and titanium (5841 +/- 3050 ng km(-1)), suggesting the possible release of actual SCR wash-coat (V2O5/TiO2) from the catalyst under the higher temperatures characteristic of cruise operation. The vanadium emissions exhibited a bi-modal mass size distribution, with modes at <0.25 mu m and 1.0-2.5 mu m size ranges for the vanadium-based SCR system. For the DPF + SCR systems, a greater fraction of the metal emissions from the zeolite-based system is water-soluble compared to emissions from the vanadium-based system.

      "The effects of land use and transportation policies on emissions, ozone concentrations, and a metric for population exposure were investigated for Austin, Texas. Three distinct transportation and land use scenarios were examined with a gravity-based land use model and a standard travel demand model: a business-as-usual scenario, a road pricing policy that included a flat-rate carbon-based tax and congestion pricing of all Austin-area freeways, and an urban growth boundary policy. Two scenarios, a business-as-usual scenario and a flat-rate carbon-based tax and congestion pricing policy, were also examined with a novel, parcel-level land use change and land use intensity model and a standard travel demand model. Transportation and land use policies were predicted to have substantial effects on travel and on emissions of ozone precursors. Emissions of ozone precursors decreased markedly for all 2030 scenarios because of the implementation of more stringent federal motor vehicle emission control programs. Transportation and land use policies were predicted to lead to greater reductions of emissions of ozone precursors relative to the business-as-usual scenario. The effects of such policies on ozone concentrations and population exposure vary. Lower exposure was predicted for the road pricing scenarios, but a penalty appeared to exist in the form of relatively higher exposure predicted for the urban growth boundary on some days. This analysis indicates the potential complexity of planning for urban growth and equity and the need for integrated modeling and policy evaluation efforts.\n",

      "Problem: The prospect that urban heat island (UHI) effects and climate change may increase urban temperatures is a problem for cities that actively promote urban redevelopment and higher densities. One possible UHI mitigation strategy is to plant more trees and other irrigated vegetation to prevent daytime heat storage and facilitate nighttime cooling, but this requires water resources that are limited in a desert city like Phoenix. Purpose: We investigated the tradeoffs between water use and nighttime cooling inherent in urban form and land use choices. Methods: We used a Local-Scale Urban Meteorological Parameterization Scheme (LUMPS) model to examine the variation in temperature and evaporation in 10 census tracts in Phoenix's urban core. After validating results with estimates of outdoor water use based on tract-level city water records and satellite imagery, we used the model to simulate the temperature and water use consequences of implementing three different scenarios. Results and conclusions: We found that increasing irrigated landscaping lowers nighttime temperatures, but this relationship is not linear; the greatest reductions occur in the least vegetated neighborhoods. A ratio of the change in water use to temperature impact reached a threshold beyond which increased outdoor water use did little to ameliorate UHI effects. Takeaway for practice: There is no one design and landscape plan capable of addressing increasing UHI and climate effects everywhere. Any one strategy will have inconsistent results if applied across all urban landscape features and may lead to an inefficient allocation of scarce water resources.

      "It is essential to the achievement of zero waste that emphasis is concentrated on front-end preventions rather than end-of-pipe (EOP) treatment. Zero waste is primarily based on cleaner production, waste management, the reduction of unnecessary consumption and the effective utilization of waste materials. The aim of this study was to briefly review the tasks undertaken and future plans for achieving zero waste in Taiwan. Waste prevention, source reduction, waste to product, waste to energy, EOP treatment, and adequate disposal are the sequential principal procedures to achieve the goal of zero waste. Six strategies have been adopted to implement the zero waste policy in Taiwan. These are regulatory amendments, consumption education, financial incentives, technical support, public awareness, and tracking and reporting. Stepwise targets have been set for 2005, 2007, 2011, and 2020 for both the municipal solid waste (MSW) and industrial waste to reach the goal of zero waste. The eventual aim is to achieve 70% MSW minimization and 85% industrial waste minimization by 2020. Although tools and measures have been established, some key programmes have higher priority. These include the establishment of a waste recycling programme, promotion of cleaner production, a green procurement programme, and promotion of public awareness. Since the implementation of the zero waste policy started in 2003, the volume of MSW for landfill and incineration has declined dramatically. The recycling and/or minimization of MSW quantity in 2007 was 37%, which is much higher than the goal of 25%. Industrial waste reached almost 76% minimization by the end of 2006, which is 1 year before the target year.\n",

      "Energy use in Bangkok accounts for a large portion of the total energy consumption in Thailand. Few energy and carbon studies, however, have focused on the level of the city. International research indicates that cities are the key drivers of energy usage and the associated carbon emissions. This paper presents a study on the options for energy and carbon development for the city of Bangkok. The Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP) model is used to simulate a range of policy interventions and to predict how these would change energy and carbon development from 2000 to 2025. The planning period is assumed to start in 2005, and 2000 is used as the baseline year. Sustainability of the sixteen proposed policies and scenarios is analyzed using a multi-criteria decision. making approach. Results of this study provide an insight into Bangkok's energy and carbon future and highlight the steps required to promote a sustainable low-carbon society. The most significant energy savings are in the transport sector, where a modal shift from private passenger vehicles to mass transit systems has the potential to significantly reduce energy demand, carbon emissions, and local air pollutants.

      "Urban transport plays an important role in city development and is also a leading sector in energy consumption and air pollutant emissions. To examine the effectiveness of policies in reducing transport influences on environment and energy use, this paper takes passenger transport system in Delhi as a case and develops a system dynamics model for scenario analysis from the base year 2006 to 2020. It is found that the implementation of certain policies will lead to a significant reduction of energy use and emissions of CO2, CH4, CO, NMVOC, and SO2 by 7-14, 7-15, 4-9, 12-23, 12-24, and 11-23%, respectively, in 2020. Bus, car, and two-wheeler need particular attentions to mitigate their environmental impacts while MRTS would be an effective solution to restrict the booming energy demand and associated air pollutant emissions. The implications for policy are that accelerating the development of railway network, together with decreasing the fuel intensity, slowing down road network extension, and imposing fuel taxes will be effective instruments to build an environmentally friendly urban transport system.\n",

      "The issue of a peak in world oil supply has become a mainstream concern over the past several years. The petroleum geology models of post-peak oil production indicate supply declines from 1.5% to 6% per year. Travel requires fuel energy, but current transportation planning models do not include the impacts of constrained fuel supply on private travel demand. This research presents a method to assess the risk to activities due to a constrained fuel supply relative to projected unconstrained travel demand. The method assesses the probability of different levels of fuel supply over a given planning horizon, then calculates impact due to the energy supply not meeting the planning expectations. A new travel demand metric which characterizes trips as essential, necessary, and optional to wellbeing is used in the calculation. A case study explores four different urban forms developed from different future growth options for the urban development strategy of Christchurch, New Zealand to 2041. Probable fuel supply availability was calculated, and the risk to transport activities in the 2041 transport model was assessed. The results showed all the urban forms had significantly reduced trip numbers and lower energy mode distributions from the current planning projections, but the risk to activities differed among the planning options. Density is clearly one of the mitigating factors, but density alone does not provide a solution to reduced energy demand. The method clearly shows how risk to participation in activities is lower for an urban form which has a high degree of human powered and public transport access to multiple options between residential and commercial/industrial/service destinations. This analysis has led to new thinking about adaptation and reorganization of urban forms as a strategy for energy demand reduction rather than just densification. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The CEN has elaborated a standard to revise all European normatives about building energy performance and HVAC plants. The \"CEN Umbrella\" CEN/TR 15615 [3] includes a new version of EN ISO 13790:2008 [4] and a new standard about heating plant, use and contributions of renewable energy sources. Furthermore, the CEN Standard provides a software version for technicians. In this paper we present a Round Robin Test between a selection of softwares applied to an Italian case study.

Furthermore, the Italian procedure described in UNI IS 11300 [5] has been analyzed and considered as the reference for all other calculation methodologies. The results of the Round Robin Test show the relationship between thoroughness of data input and energy evaluation accurancy. The more the input data is affected by uncertainty, the less precise is the energy efficiency calculation. On the other hand the energy performance of building evaluation accurancy depends on the aim of the simulation: the energy audit, the energy design or the energy labeling (certification).

Four mitigation or energy conservation measures - raising the indoor temperature, thermal insulation, double glazing and tinted glass - were considered. Among them, raising the indoor temperature has the best mitigation potential because there is a growing awareness and recognition of adaptive thermal comfort and it can be readily applied to both existing and new buildings at no extra cost.

It analyzes the main energy challenges related to road transportation development arising in the context of economic development, rapid urbanization, and improvement in living standards. It also discusses technological- and policy initiatives needed to deal with these challenges, drawing comparisons with foreign experience: promoting the development and dissemination of alternative fuels and clean vehicles such as: LPG, CNG, EV, HEV, FCV, ethanol, methanol, DME, bio-diesel, and CTL, strengthening regulations relating to vehicle fuel economy and emission, improving traffic efficiency and facilitating public transport development, and strengthening management of the soaring motor vehicle population.

The potential energy saving capacity being 60%, the actual oil demand by 2030 from on-road vehicles might technically be kept at the current level by improving fuel economy, propagating use of HEV and diesel vehicles, improving supply of alternative fuels, and developing public transport.

Many of them extend beyond traditional state department of transportation (DOT) activities and span of control. There is an interconnection between transportation and land use that the public and local decision makers do not often see. Yet the public frequently holds DOTs responsible for solving transportation problems resulting from local and regional land use decisions and preferred development patterns. The objective of this research is to identify and explore successful innovations in integrating transportation and land use planning for transportation corridors, with a focus on practices that could be transferred to other locations. A case study approach was used to identify projects that integrated, rather than merely linked, land use and transportation planning and decision making.

      "This study analyses the impact of integrated mass rapid transit system (IMRTS) and other policy measures on air emissions from vehicular sources in Delhi region. The impacts have been studied for the passenger and goods vehicles separately. For this purpose three alternative scenarios for the passenger vehicles and two alternative scenarios for the goods vehicles have been analysed for the year 2021. The interventions include stringent source emission norms, modal shift resulting from introduction of effective public transport alternatives, speed regulation measures and hiking of parking fee of private vehicles. These scenarios have been compared to the base year 2007. An important finding that emerged from the study is that stringent fuel emission norms and introduction of alternative public transport systems alone may not result in the modal shift and hence reduction in exhaust emissions. It is actually a combination of these measures and management measures such as increased parking fee and regulated uniform speed of public transport that results in desired benefits. Further, the inclusion of goods vehicle demand during transport policy formulation can help in controlling air pollution in new urban centres in India and in major developing regions of the world.

Despite a favourable trend in leisure-time cycling, cycling is infrequently used for everyday travel needs in New Zealand. This study investigated cyclists' attitudes toward environmental and policy measures that would encourage them to cycle more, particularly for a trip to work. A cross-sectional analysis was undertaken using baseline data obtained from the Taupo Bicycle Study, a web-based longitudinal study. The study population comprised 2469 cyclists, aged 16 years or over, who had enrolled in the 2006 Wattyl Lake Taupo Cycle Challenge. The majority (88%) reported the provision of bicycle lanes as an important factor that would encourage them to cycle more often, followed by bicycle paths (76%), better bicycle security (64%), reduced motor vehicle speed (55%) and bike friendly public transport (38%). Of those who reported travelling to work at least once a week (N = 2223), varying proportions reported shower facilities at work (61%), fewer difficult intersections (43%), rising fuel costs (41%), fewer car parks (27%), bike designed to commute (26%) and rising cost of car parking (25%) as important factors that would encourage them to cycle to work more often.

      "Background: Active transportation to school has been positively associated with various health parameters whereas only sparse evidence exists on risk of injury while commuting to school. This study investigated the overall effectiveness of cycling promotion combined with structural changes on cycling to school. Methods: Interventions at public schools in three different regions in Denmark were based on planned infrastructural changes near schools (e.g. road surface and traffic regulation) and school-motivation for promoting commuter cycling. Participants were pupils from control schools (n = 12) or intervention schools (n = 13). All children (n = 2415) from the 4th and 5th grade were measured at baseline during spring 2010 and at follow-up one year later. Results: No significant differences in commuter cycling were detected in the adjusted analyses comparing the intervention with the control group neither when assessed as changes in short term (beta: 0.15 trips/week, p = 0.463) nor when assessed as changes in long term school cycling (beta: -0.02 units, p = 0.485). No differences were observed neither in the incidence of traffic injuries nor in the characteristics of injuries when comparing the control group and the intervention group. Approximately 50 % of all traffic injuries occurred during school transport with most injuries categorized as solo injuries. The only significant predictor of future traffic injuries was previous school transport injuries. Conclusion: This multifaceted school cycling promotion programme did not affect school cycling behaviour or the health parameters assessed. Implementation issues relevant in the planning of future school cycling interventions are discussed in the article. The one year incidence of being involved in a traffic injury was approximately 25 % with almost 50 % of all traffic injuries occurred during school transport.

      "Decision makers facing emission-reduction targets need to decide which abatement measures to implement, and in which order. This article investigates how marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves can inform such a decision. We re-analyse a MAC curve built for Brazil by 2030, and show that misinterpreting MAC curves as abatement supply curves can lead to suboptimal strategies. It would lead to (1) under-investment in expensive, long-to-implement and large-potential options, such as clean transportation infrastructure, and (2) over-investment in cheap but limited-potential options such as energy-efficiency improvement in refineries. To mitigate this issue, the article proposes a new graphical representation of MAC curves that explicitly renders the time required to implement each measure.Policy relevanceIn addition to the cost and potential of available options, designing optimal short-term policies requires information on long-term targets (e.g. halving emissions by 2050) and on the speed at which measures can deliver emission reductions. Mitigation policies are thus best investigated in a dynamic framework, building on sector-scale pathways to long-term targets. Climate policies should seek both quantity and quality of abatement, by combining two approaches: a synergy approach' that focuses on the cheapest mitigation options and maximizes co-benefits, and an urgency approach' that starts from a long-term objective and works backward to identify actions that need to be implemented early. Accordingly, sector-specific policies may be used (1) to remove implementation barriers on negative- and low-cost options and (2) to ensure short-term targets are met with abatement of sufficient quality. Indeed, such policies can avoid under-investment in the long-to-implement options required to reach long-term targets, which are otherwise difficult to enforce.\n",

To achieve this, more stringent performance requirements are needed. The intent of this work is to develop a framework and preliminary policy implementation strategy to achieve an 80% reduction in heating energy consumption by 2035 for newly constructed single-family dwellings across Ontario (Canada). A tiered framework of heating energy consumption targets was developed using current (2012) Ontario building code requirements as the baseline and building enclosure/HVAC requirements estimated as necessary to achieve the Passive House Standard in Ontario's two climate zones. An Ontario based large track homebuilder estimated construction capital costs for each tier to examine potential cost barriers against implementation. A significant cost premium of over $65 000 (CAD) (54%) exists between the baseline consumption and the overall 80% heating energy reduction target; a result of unfamiliarity and lack of experience designing and constructing to the proposed levels.

However, urban transportation systems are complex and involve social, economic, and environmental aspects. We present solutions for a sustainable urban transportation system by establishing a simplified system dynamics model with a timeframe of 30 years (from 1995 to 2025) to simulate the effects of urban transportation management policies and to explore their potential in reducing vehicular fuel consumption and mitigating CO2 emissions. Kaohsiung City was selected as a case study because it is the second largest metropolis in Taiwan and is an important industrial center. Three policies are examined in the study including fuel tax, motorcycle parking management, and free bus service. Simulation results indicate that both the fuel tax and motorcycle parking management policies are suggested as potentially the most effective methods for restraining the growth of the number of private vehicles, the amount of fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions. We also conducted a synthetic policy consisting of all policies which outperforms the three individual policies. The conclusions of this study can assist urban transport planners in designing appropriate urban transport management strategies and can assist transport operation agencies in creating operational strategies to reduce their energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The proposed approach should be generalized in other cities to develop an appropriate model to understand the various effects of policies on energy and CO2 emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A model is developed to estimate individual consumption behaviors and demand of mobility goods and non-mobility goods at micro level. By considering the economic factor of income, the energy consumption is calculated based on demand of goods under Business as usual scenario, Central Core City scenario, and Multi-pole structure scenario. Results indicate the urban structure influences individual consumption behaviors and energy consumption. Increased consumption of the non-mobility goods and mass transit trips is shown in Central Core City scenario and the Multi-pole structure scenario. Monocentric urban structures as shown in Central Core City scenario show less effect on energy consumption than the polycentric urban structure in Multi-pole structure scenario. The findings suggest that the multi-pole urban structure is a better choice for compact development in Kumamoto based on less energy consumption. The method in this study provides a new approach to analyze the influence of urban structure on energy consumption at micro level.

The Maldives, which scientists, politicians, and activists predict could be completely submerged by 2100, filled that role between the 2008 inauguration of Mohamed Nasheed, the country's first democratically elected president after years of authoritarian rule, and his 2012 ouster. This ethnography of the Maldivian challenge to climate change asks how claiming a geopolitical identity as the world's \"canary in the coalmine\" fostered an emerging internal political culture.I argue that arming climate change solutions became a state-making device in the Maldives, whose fragile coral atoll ecosystem itself became the synecdoche of a young democracy. Between 2008 and 2012, how was environmental knowledge creation understood as a democratic activity? To answer this question, I draw on ethnographic interview testimony and participant-observation in Male, the Maldivian capital, with politicians, activists, and city residents, as well as an analysis of the Nasheed administration's public rhetoric. The article centers on the case of Bluepeace, the country's oldest environmental NGO, which has seen significant international publicity. Following Bluepeace's efforts to help the Maldives achieve carbon neutrality by 2020-part of Nasheed's plan to end global climate change through exemplary national sacrifice this article finds that climate problem solving and democracy were put to work for one another through small-scale mitigation and adaptation experiments.

      "Although there is growing public awareness about environmental issues, incentive mechanisms leading to individual pro-environmental behaviors remain less investigated. This article examines the impact of bottle deposit laws (BDL), municipal recycling programs (MRP), and the ease of municipal recycling on recycling frequency for numerous products. An online survey of U.S. and Canadian households was conducted to collect data about individuals' recycling practices and perceptions. We contracted an online survey company, Global Market Insite (GMI), to recruit panelists within their database to take the survey. GMI invited 2700 consumer panelists within their database representing all contiguous U.S. states and all Canadian provinces with 2511 surveys completed. Utilizing specific treatment groups and propensity score matching to control for unobserved heterogeneity, we find that MRP has a greater impact on recycling behaviors than BDL, and that the perceived ease of MRP positively influences individual recycling behaviors. For BDL without a municipal program being present, their effect is only for those products requiring the deposit. This research is useful for agencies interested in encouraging recycling behavior and researchers interested in the determinants of recycling behavior. Both programs should be measured for effectiveness and municipal recycling programs should be implemented where the goal is to promote recycling behavior as it was shown here to have a greater impact on recycling programs and may be perceived as an easier thing to do.

      "There is increasing interest in the potential of cities to contribute to climate mitigation. Multiple assessments have evaluated the scale and composition of urban GHG emissions, while others have evaluated some aspects of urban mitigation potential. However, assessments of mitigation potential tend to be broadly focused, few if any have evaluated urban mitigation potential on a measure-by-measure basis, and fewer still have considered the economic case for investing in these measures. This is a significant knowledge gap as an economic case for action could be critical in building political commitment, strengthening institutional capacities, securing large-scale finance and targeting investment and implementation in cities. In this paper, we conduct a comparative analysis of the results of five recently completed studies that examined the economic case for investing in low-carbon measures in five cities: Leeds in the UK, Kolkata in India, Lima in Peru, Johor Bahru in Malaysia and Palembang in Indonesia. The results demonstrate that there is a compelling economic case for cities in both developed and developing country contexts to invest, at scale, in cost-effective low-carbon measures. The results suggest that these investments could generate significant reductions (in the range of 15-24% relative to business-as-usual trends) in urban carbon emissions over the next 10 years. Securing these savings would require an average investment of $3.2 billion per city, which if spread over 10 years equates to 0.4-0.9% of city GDP per year. However, the savings generated in the form of reduced energy bills would be equivalent to between 1.7% and 9.5% of annual city-scale GDP, and the average payback period of investments would be approximately 2 years at commercial interest rates. We provisionally estimate that if these findings were replicated and similar investments were made in cities globally, then they could generate reductions equivalent to 10-18% of global energy-related GHG emissions in 2025. While the studies offer some grounds for optimism, they also raise important questions about the barriers to change that prevent these economically attractive options from being exploited and about the scope for mitigation based on the exploitation of only the economically attractive options. We therefore discuss the institutional capacities, policy environments and financing arrangements that need to be developed before even these economically attractive opportunities can be exploited. We also demonstrate that, in rapidly growing cities, the carbon savings from such investments could be quickly overwhelmed - in as little as 7 years - by the impacts of sustained population and economic growth. We conclude by highlighting the need to build capacities that enable the exploitation not only of the economically attractive options in the short term but also of those deeper and more structural changes that are likely to be needed in the longer term.

      "The article provides a review on Heat Pumps (HPs) implementation in Lithuania in compliance with the National Energy Strategy and European policy and encompasses the period 2005-2013 after the Lithuanian integration into the EU.Lithuania has limited quantity of indigenous energy resources and is dependent on the import of natural gas, petroleum and hard coal. Up, to 2009, Lithuania's energy dependence on the imports of fuel and energy was about 50-62%. At the end of 2009, after the decommissioning of the Lithuanian Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant (INPP), energy dependence on the imports of energy resources increased remarkably to approximately 80-82% and considerably exceeded the EU average 53-54%. The share of indigenous and renewable energy sources (RES) in gross inland fuel and energy consumption in Lithuania increased from 11.2% (RES 8.7%) in 2005 to 21.4% (RES 17.6%) in 2013. About 48% of such energy sources were transformed in Combined Heat and Power (CHP) and heat plants, 38% belonged to households and 14% - to industry and other sectors.In the article, the HPs implementation in Lithuania and European countries was overviewed. The analysis of HPs promotion in Lithuania was carried out. HP related legislation in Lithuanian and Europe was shown. Regulations on HPs installation and usage of refrigerants were disclosed. Aims and tasks of Lithuanian Heat Pump Association were indicated. The dissemination and manufacture of perspective HPs were investigated. Lithuanian HPs market characteristics and technological trends were reviewed.

      "In this paper the new dynamic method for calculation of energy for heating, cooling and mechanical ventilation is presented. The method is based on a combination of the simple hourly method, from EN ISO 13790, and a modification of the existing calculation procedure for determination of the energy need for mechanical ventilation, described in Algorithm for calculation of the energy need for HVAC systems. Developed method, incorporated in Croatian national Algorithms used for energy certification of buildings, enables the determination of the hourly energy need for heating and cooling which includes all energy flows that occur during the air conditioning process (moistening, dehumidifying, etc.). Simulations are performed for a Croatian reference dwelling, equipped with two different HVAC systems. The results are compared against those obtained from the quasi-steady state monthly method, also described in Algorithms. The comparison proved that the application of the quasi-steady state method would preclude the correct calculations in buildings with air conditioning.\n",

      "In 2013 the European Commission launched its new green infrastructure strategy to make another attempt to stop and possibly reverse the loss of biodiversity until 2020, by connecting habitats in the wider landscape. This means that conservation would go beyond current practices to include landscapes that are dominated by conventional agriculture, where biodiversity conservation plays a minor role at best. The green infrastructure strategy aims at bottom-up rather than top-down implementation, and suggests including local and regional stakeholders. Therefore, it is important to know which stakeholders influence land-use decisions concerning green infrastructure at the local and regional level. The research presented in this paper served to select stakeholders in preparation for a participatory scenario development process to analyze consequences of different implementation options of the European green infrastructure strategy. We used a mix of qualitative and quantitative social network analysis (SNA) methods to combine actors' attributes, especially concerning their perceived influence, with structural and relational measures. Further, our analysis provides information on institutional backgrounds and governance settings for green infrastructure and agricultural policy. The investigation started with key informant interviews at the regional level in administrative units responsible for relevant policies and procedures such as regional planners, representatives of federal ministries, and continued at the local level with farmers and other members of the community. The analysis revealed the importance of information flows and regulations but also of social pressure, considerably influencing biodiversity governance with respect to green infrastructure and biodiversity.\n",

      "Ventilation represents a significant portion of building energy consumption. Current codes and standards do not offer adequate guidance with respect to energy efficiency and to the relationship between the ventilation rate and the degree of indoor hazard. For the sake of energy savings, it is of great importance to study the associations between ventilation rates and indoor air quality (IAQ). Hence, in this work we aimed to investigate the influence of ventilation rates on IAQ for an indoor ventilated enclosure. Herein, ventilation efficiency is represented by the maximal local volume-averaged concentration and recirculation rate. In the present study, computation fluid dynamics (CFD) was applied and the low-Renumber k-epsilon model (verified by experiments) was selected for Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations, with buoyancy effects considered due to density differences. We found that when increasing the inlet ventilation rates, the impact on indoor pollutant concentration was considerable due to the increase in the turbulent diffusion effects. Moreover, this was less dependent on the larger range of slot Reynolds numbers (for the current study, Re-s >= 3000) and it ultimately tends to show an asymptotic behavior, which refutes the common working hypothesis of \"the larger the ventilation rates, the better the IAQ\". These findings should further play an important role in the design of energy-efficient ventilation systems.\n",

      "Cities are responsible for nearly 75% of the world's energy consumption; expectedly, about 90% of future growth will occur in urban areas. However, we consider that cities will be at the forefront of implementing groundbreaking technologies and policies, as evidenced in the initiatives taken by many cities here and worldwide to resolve issues in energy and climate change. In addition to affording energy and environmental benefits, investments in energy efficient and renewable technologies have huge potential to boost local economies, as demonstrated by the recent federal allocation of stimulus funding. Inclined to give priority to stopgap measures, many cities tend to regard comprehensive long-term planning as secondary. However, such solutions would bring multiple benefits to the community. The paper showcases an energy and environment systems model to provide a quantitative vision of technology and management strategy options for effectively deploying energy efficiency and renewable energy for reducing the carbon footprint, while sustainably maintaining the energy demands of the community and the servicing environmental infrastructure. We provide results of a case study completed for New York City, to showcase usefulness of long-term planning for achieving low carbon cities. Combined with appropriate stakeholder participation, such a technology explicit bottom-up approach holds the promise of influencing the current energy planning, environmental regulatory regime, including multimedia aspects of carbon control for cities locally and internationally.

      "The Government of India has announced the Greening India Mission (GIM) under the National Climate Change Action Plan. The Mission aims to restore and afforest about 10 mha over the period 2010-2020 under different sub-missions covering moderately dense and open forests, scrub/grasslands, mangroves, wetlands, croplands and urban areas. Even though the main focus of the Mission is to address mitigation and adaptation aspects in the context of climate change, the adaptation component is inadequately addressed. There is a need for increased scientific input in the preparation of the Mission. The mitigation potential is estimated by simply multiplying global default biomass growth rate values and area. It is incomplete as it does not include all the carbon pools, phasing, differing growth rates, etc. The mitigation potential estimated using the Comprehensive Mitigation Analysis Process model for the GIM for the year 2020 has the potential to offset 6.4% of the projected national greenhouse gas emissions, compared to the GIM estimate of only 1.5%, excluding any emissions due to harvesting or disturbances. The selection of potential locations for different interventions and species choice under the GIM must be based on the use of modelling, remote sensing and field studies. The forest sector provides an opportunity to promote mitigation and adaptation synergy, which is not adequately addressed in the GIM. Since many of the interventions proposed are innovative and limited scientific knowledge exists, there is need for an unprecedented level of collaboration between the research institutions and the implementing agencies such as the Forest Departments, which is currently non-existent. The GIM could propel systematic research into forestry and climate change issues and thereby provide global leadership in this new and emerging science.\n",

      "Based on a systematic analysis of Beijing's Urban Transportation-Environment Systems (UTES), an integrated model is built, seeking an optimized and feasible trip mode structure on the premise of resident trip demands, environmental and resource capacity, and feasibility of policy adjustment in Beijing. First, a system dynamics model and a linear optimization model are founded for the Business-as-Usual simulation and best results of transportation development. Next, eight ameliorated scenarios combining four policies on Clean Transportation, Bus Priority, Subway Priority, and Car Trip Restriction are re-simulated. Finally, the results from nine scenarios are compared with the optimized results through grey correlation assessment. Findings show that adjustment policies have positive effects on the improvement of UTES, although these are varied and occur at different time scales. Integrated adjustment measures for sustainable transportation should be employed in Beijing because a combination of policies yields better effects than individual regulations. The derived optimized trip mode structures of Beijing in 2020 for subways, taxis, cars, buses and bicycling or walking are 19.41, 2.58, 24.99, 32.57 and 20.46% respectively, while daily resident trips reach 59.5 million.

      "Throughout Asia, rapid and uncontrolled urbanization has created serious environmental problems, and the development of sustainable urban-rural planning methods is of critical importance. To improve our understanding of mixed urban-rural land uses and provide future practical visions for regional planning, we conducted a case study of the urban fringe of the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, Thailand. After identifying local irrigation districts as the basic spatial unit for resource circulation, we quantified current material flows of organic wastes generated by households within each district. We then developed two different land-use scenarios for 2020: (1) a high-rise compact and (2) a low-story sprawl development scenario. These scenarios were compared in terms of efficiency of material flows and energy consumption. We found that, based on current infrastructure and technology, the latter scenario was more advantageous in terms of both material input and energy consumption than the former, thereby, identifying positive aspects of urban-rural land-use mixture. Based on these results, we propose that planners should focus on density control measures that take into account bioresource circulation within irrigation districts rather than simply drawing arbitrary land-use zoning lines. To this end, we suggest that the division between agricultural and urban planning departments must be bridged, and that research should take an interdisciplinary approach.\n",

      "The gap between calculated and actual energy use has long be recognized as a major hurdle for a realistic assessment of buildings' performance and anticipated benefits from energy conservation measures, especially when attempting a national building stock analysis. A multinational European effort to develop a conceptual framework for monitoring the effectiveness of energy retrofit measures applied in the European housing sector has motivated a number of national pilot actions. This paper presents the results from the work carried out in Greece and elaborates a methodology for deriving different empirical adaptation factors that relate the normative calculated heating energy consumption from energy performance certificates (EPC) with the actual energy use. To gain some additional insight, the work is complemented by evidence from field surveys to collect actual energy use data from dwellings before and after refurbishment and behavioural surveys of occupants. The derived factors are used to adapt the predictions, which are then organized according to the Hellenic residential building typology. The overall approach is used with a building stock model to demonstrate a preliminary assessment of different energy conservation measures, towards meeting the national targets for 2020 and 2030. The ratio of actual to calculated primary energy consumption using the processed EPC data from over 8500 dwellings, averages 0.56 (i.e. 44% lower energy use than calculated). Findings from field surveys of occupant behavioural changes in the operation of space heating systems, confirm poor indoor thermal comfort conditions resulting from reduced operating hours of space heating, lower thermostat settings etc., which deviate significantly from normative calculation assumptions. Other field data on actual energy use before and after refurbishment provide additional insight for adapting the predicted savings as a result of common retrofit actions. Popular measures include for older buildings the installation of double glazed windows, the replacement of heat production systems and roof thermal insulation. On average, the weather corrected actual primary heating energy savings are about 21% by installing double glazed windows and about 18% by replacing an oil-fired boiler with a new natural gas unit. The application of the results with a building stock model illustrates that future energy and emission targets could be reached with the conservative adaptation factors, but will mandate combined measures and more aggressive modernization rates using an average trend scenario.

One of the reasons is that the performance of buildings and its components degrade over the years. In recent years, energy benchmarking for government office buildings, large scale public buildings and large commercial buildings is one of the key energy saving projects for promoting the development of building energy efficiency and sustainable energy savings in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Benchmarking would increase the purchase of energy efficient equipment, reducing energy bills, CO2 emissions and conventional air pollution. This paper focuses on energy benchmarking for shopping centers in Gulf Coast Region. In addition, this paper will analyze a sample of shopping centers data in Gulf Coast Region (Dubai, Ajman, Sharjah, Oman and Bahrain). It aims to develop a benchmark for these shopping centers by highlighting the status of energy consumption performance. This research will support the sustain ability movement in Gulf area through classifying the shopping centers into: Poor, Usual and Best Practices in terms of energy efficiency. According to the benchmarking analysis in this paper, the shopping centers best energy management practices in the Gulf Coast Region are the buildings that consume less than 810 kW h/m(2)/yr, whereas the poor building practices are the centers that consume greater than 1439 kW h/m(2)/yr. The conclusions of this work can be used as a reference for shopping centres benchmarking with similar climate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Frequent site energy consumption auditing is a potential strategy to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from existing buildings. Such a strategy has been practised in Australia for nearly 15 years. This paper documents and analyses the effect of repetitive audits on measured site energy consumption. Using a self-constructed database of over 3500 audited disclosures representing over 800 unique office buildings, empirical models demonstrate that measured site energy consumption declines, on average, over the first five re-certification periods. The results also suggest a market average post-certification equilibrium in Australia of approximately 430MJ/m(2)/year (120kWh/m(2)/year) within approximately six years, if all else - including green management strategy - is held constant. Since GHG emissions from buildings in Australia are highly correlated with site energy consumption, such a result is comparable with meeting 50-year GHG mitigation targets reliant on the implementation of existing technologies. This suggests that repetitive auditing is a successful approach for motivating owners to invest in existing energy efficiency technologies.\n",

Identification of the amounts and valuable-resource components of the \"new\" WEEE generated is critical to solving the e-waste problem, for both governmental policy decisions and recycling enterprise expansions. This study first estimates and predicts China's new WEEE generation for the period of 2010-2030 using material flow analysis and the lifespan model of the Weibull distribution, then determines the amounts of valuable resources (e.g., base materials, precious metals, and rare-earth minerals) encased annually in WEEE, and their dynamic transfer from in-use stock to waste. Main findings include the following: (i) China will generate 15.5 and 28.4 million tons WEEE in 2020 and 2030, respectively, and has already overtaken the U.S. to become the world's leading producer of e-waste; (ii) among all the types of WEEE, air conditioners, desktop personal computers, refrigerators, and washing machines contribute over 70% of total WEEE by weight. The two categories of EEE-electronic devices and electrical appliances each contribute about half of total WEEE by weight; (iii) more and more valuable resources have been transferred from in-use products to WEEE, significantly enhancing the recycling potential of WEEE from an economic perspective; and (iv) WEEE recycling potential has been evolving from similar to 1.6 (10-22) billion US$ in 2010, to an anticipated similar to 42 (26-58) billion US$ in 2020 and similar to 73.4 (44.5-103.4) billion US$ by 2030.

      "As reported in the scientific literature and mentioned in building energy performance legislation, the thermal inertia of the opaque building envelope can have a significant positive impact on the reduction of summer indoor overheating, of space cooling peak load and of electricity consumption. At the early stages of the envelope design, there is a need to use simplified as well as effective parameters to correctly characterize the thermal performance of the opaque envelope under dynamic conditions. In this work, a new methodology to describe the dynamic thermal behavior of opaque components is proposed. The approach is based on the harmonic parameters specified in ISO 13786 but it also takes into account realistic boundary conditions for different orientations and solar absorptance values. New equivalent thermal parameters are determined by means of dynamic simulations. The use of these parameters to assess the conduction heat flow rate by means of a simplified model is validated through a comparison with the results of a dynamic simulation. The method presented in the article represents an improvement with respect to the parameters usually applied at the early design stage to thermally characterize the opaque envelope of the building under dynamic conditions. In fact, it allows simplified but reliable performance parameters referring to actual boundary conditions to be obtained. The application potential of the proposed methodology lies in the drawing -up of catalogues and technical standards that supply the values of the new equivalent thermal parameters for different technical solutions.

      "The waste treatment related to the End-of-Life phase of durable goods such as electric and electronic equipment and road vehicles is increasingly regulated both from a European and a worldwide point of view. Regarding the transport sector, most L-class vehicles (mopeds, motorcycles, tricycles, quadricycles as defined in Regulation 168/2013/EU) are not fully subjected to the Directive 2000/53/EC, which is the reference for other light vehicle categories. The recent introduction of novel archetypes and innovative powertrains for L-vehicles suggests that such products represent an actual alternative to full conventional vehicles for urban mobility; however, only limited data are available regarding their Recyclability and Recoverability. In order to cover such gap, a comprehensive view of L-class vehicle characteristics from End-of-Life perspective is proposed. The objectives of the study are the definition and the critical analysis of the context in which L-class vehicles are supposed to be treated, the identification of End of-Life assessment methodologies and the application on a case study. Two different methodologies are compared; both come from other transport sectors. The methodologies differ in terms of performance assessment of recycling and recovery processes. The treatment of the vehicle has been reproduced in controlled condition to obtain a detailed inventory of parts. Furthermore, four different hypotheses regarding the accuracy of the treatment have been formulated. The data have been used to estimate vehicle Recyclability and Recoverability rates under the proposed scenarios. The results demonstrate the compliance of Recyclability and Recoverability rates according to the most demanding regulation adopted for automotive products, even if such characteristics are not type approval requirements. The comparison between the two assessment methods shows that satisfactory Recyclability and Recoverability values can be achieved also considering technological limitations, at the cost of increased dismantling effort. The variability of results on the basis of external conditions is calculated, estimating four cases from \"worst\" to \"best\" option. The discrepancies between the results of the two assessments methods and the relation to realistic limitations are discussed. Using the first assessment method - ISO 22628 - it is calculated that the dismantling of the bodywork is sufficient to achieve a 85% recyclability result, and higher values are obtained in case of favorable scenario; Recoverability is also assessed to be above 95%. Using a method taking into account technological limitations - UNIFE assessment, adapted from railway sector- lower values are calculated, the reduction being from 1% to 3% for Recyclability and from 3% to 15% for Recoverability, depending on the boundary conditions considered. Further research should be done to improve the assessment methods and to estimate the effective waste production arising from vehicle treatment, thus identifying physical and technological limits in relation to the product and to the context under study. For the sector of L-class vehicles, the study should be extended to a range of products, validating data through on-field trials. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Attention to the global warming has influenced many aspects of human activities. Worldwide effort toward energy consumption reduction in building sector is one of the areas affected by climate change. Building regulations demand the building construction industry to be more energy efficient. Studies have been carried out on the thermal performance of energy efficient buildings under future climates, while studies on the durability of energy efficient building envelopes over future climates are limited. This study assesses the impact of future climates on the durability of typical Canadian residential wall assemblies retrofitted to the PassiveHaus over the current, 2020, 2050, and 2080 climatic conditions for Montreal. The durability performance is evaluated in terms of the frost damage risk of bricks and the biodegradation risk of plywood sheathing through simulations using WUFI Pro program. The future weather files are generated based on weather data recorded at the Montreal International Airport weather station using General Circulation Model HadCM3 based on the A2 emission scenario by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This study concludes that upgrading wall assemblies to the PassiveHaus recommended level would increase the frost damage risk of bricks, however, this risk would decrease under 2080 climatic conditions. While the decay risk of the plywood sheathing would decrease, the mould growth risk defined by RHT criteria would increase over future climates. Under future climates, mould growth risks of the plywood defined by the mould growth index exist only when rain leakage is introduced and would likely decrease for the double-stud assembly.

A comprehensive inspection survey was conducted for all 21 hospitals located in the study area. Field visits were conducted to provide information on the different medical waste management aspects. The results reported here focus on the level of medical waste segregation, treatment and disposal options practiced in the study area hospitals. The total number of beds in the hospitals was 2296, and the anticipated quantity of medical waste generated by these hospitals was about 1400 kg/day. The most frequently used treatment practice for solid medical waste was incineration. Of these hospitals, only 48% had incinerators, and none of these incinerators met the Ministry of Health (MoH) regulations. As for the liquid medical waste, the survey results indicated that 57% of surveyed hospitals were discharging it into the municipal sewer system, while the remaining hospitals were collecting their liquid waste in septic tanks. The results indicated that the medical waste generation rate ranges from approximately 0.5 to 2.2 kg/bed day, which is comprised of 90% of infectious waste and 10% sharps.

      "The expansion of motor vehicle fleet in China during the past decade has produced a cascade of challenges, including dealing with end-of-life passenger cars. To date, these cars have not been effectively collected or recycled. Policies must be deliberately devised and reformed to facilitate state-of-the-art vehicle recycling and minimize waste arising from end-of-life cars. In this study, dynamic modeling and cost-benefit analysis have been employed to investigate how polices, including government subsidies, a value added tax and a deposit-refund system, may affect recycling of end-of-life passenger cars. The results indicate that a combination of deposits and subsidies will surpass all of the other independent policies in terms of the recycling rate. This combination is expected to lead to a recycling rate of 80% of end-of-life passenger cars by 2050. However, the government will have to pay an annual 62 billion Chinese Yuan in the middle of the century for old-for-new replacement subsidies, posing a heavy burden on public finance. Comparatively, the deposit-only scenario will cost the government 4.7 billion Chinese Yuan and elevate the recycling rate to 46% in 2050. These policies may help curb the black market and promote the legitimate business of dismantling and recycling in the long run. Moreover, the prospect of vehicle remanufacturing will play another key role in diminishing the black market. The results in China are compared with policies and practices in Europe, Japan and South Korea to help decision-makers develop the most appropriate strategies for end-of-life vehicle management.

      "By the year 2050, more than 70% of the world's population will be living in cities. The rush to the cities, along with subsequent increased consumption patterns, has dire consequences, for the ecological systems that sustain human life. Some find hope in the potential that cities can be built differently, that green infrastructure and denser forms of development, will satisfy human needs while decreasing the stress on valuable resources and mitigating consequences of climate change. Some say that \"strong political leadership and robust governance\" is critical for this need to drive sustainable urban transitions. However, are \"political will\" and \"good governance\" enough or is the issue more complicated than this? Using a critical political economy approach this paper shows the fundamental difficulties that arise when attempting to transition urban centres to \"smarter\", more \"sustainable\" and \"resilient\" cities. Ultimately, the paper argues that \"good governance\" and \"strong political will\" are inadequate for understanding the requirements for transformation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

      "To achieve European Union (EU) greenhouse gas emissions of 80-95% below 1990 levels by 2050, CO2 emissions from residential energy consumption must be substantially reduced. Recognition of this has led to the introduction of a range of policy instruments at both EU and member state level. These policies are examined for the EU and the UK, first by grouping them into three pillars of policy' - standards and engagement, markets and pricing, and strategic investment (each of which focus on different domains of change' embodying different economic processes) - and then by assessing the strengths and weaknesses of each pillar in terms of instrument coverage and effectiveness. Strengths and weaknesses common to both UK and EU policy landscapes are found, including a comprehensive but broadly ineffective standards and engagement pillar of policy, and an ineffective markets and pricing landscape (including effective subsidization of energy consumption in the UK, permitted by the EU), with poor coverage. The strategic investment landscape is found (until recently) to be substantially stronger in the UK compared with EU instruments and requirements. Priority reform actions are also proposed to address the weaknesses identified. The paper also offers discussion of recent policy developments in the UK.\n",

      "By 2020, different European Directives on the energy performance of buildings (EPBD) aim to reduce energy consumption by 20%, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% and endorse a target of a 20% share of energy from renewable sources. These Directives have led EU Member States to develop systems, following their corresponding transposition into national law, to evaluate the energy efficiency of buildings, and create different Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs). This has led to different energy efficiency measurement systems in the EU and a CO2 emissions scale has not been included by some Member States. Just as EPC is aimed at influencing the demand for energy-efficient buildings, this study is aimed at developing a straightforward procedure to obtain the environmental impact in the use phase of a building in kgCO(2)/m(2) year in order to influence the demand for buildings with a low impact on climate change. By applying this methodology to different case studies, we can conclude that obtaining the formula drastically simplifies the calculation of CO2 emissions in KgCO(2)/m(2) year. The results obtained from applying this methodology will serve to record CO2 emission rates in single-family houses on a yearly basis, thus contributing to the study of applications that address climate change mitigation.

      "While many countries have set ambitious targets for reducing energy use and GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions, it remains highly uncertain whether the policies introduced will be suitable to reach these targets at the specified times. Models used to inform building policies often do not account for the different boundary conditions related to socio-economic development, climate, composition and age structure of the existing building stock, and lifetime expectancy, which hinders effective strategy development and realistic target setting. This study presents a dynamic Type-Cohort-Time (TCT) stock-driven modelling approach that considers demographic aspects, lifestyle-related issues, and building-specific characteristics. Case studies were conducted for the dwelling stocks in Germany and the Czech Republic, two countries with different boundary conditions, but that are sheltered under the same European energy reduction policies and goals. The effects of the policies on nearly zero energy buildings and increased renovation rates were tested. The results showed that current regulations are sufficient to achieve the 20% energy efficiency goal by 2020, but not to reach the 2050 energy and GHG-emission goals. The scenarios further demonstrate that the same policies on renovation and construction in different countries lead to different energy reduction levels. Accordingly, country-specific policies and measures are suggested. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "One of the biggest challenges for Brazilian cities is properly nmanaging the more than 180 000 tons of municipal solid waste collected daily in the country. This article shows how this challenge is being faced in Brazil. There are legal and regulatory instruments in place, in particular the Basic Sanitation National Policy (Law no. 11.445/2007) and the Solid Waste Law (Law no. 12.305/2010). However, the targets set by the National Solid Waste Policy to put an end to dumps and dispose of waste in landfills only from June 2014 were not met. There are still dumps in over 3000 cities, which have a significant impact on environmental and public health. The universalized provision of selective collection services is present in only 20% of Brazilian cities. The large and growing market for recycling is based on the work of thousands of waste pickers, who work on the streets, live in precarious conditions, are subject to environmental hazards and put their own health at risk. Noteworthy is the selective collection model operated jointly by municipalities and waste picker organizations, formed into associations and cooperatives, and the lack of compensation for their services to industry, governments and society.\n",

      "A rapid growth in car ownership in the cities of Lithuania, particularly in Vilnius, has generated continuous traffic jams in the streets and thus has consequently increased negative transport impact and demand for financial and land resources. Also, a high level of car ownership requires large reserves of transport infrastructure. Therefore, it is necessary to create favourable conditions for creating sustainable urban transport infrastructure satisfying the needs of local inhabitants. Within the framework of the European Union Structural Assistance for the period 2014-2020, Vilnius city municipality administration is planning to submit an application to receive financial support for the implementation of the Park-and-Ride (hereinafter P&R) scheme for Vilnius. The aim of the paper is to work out a multi-criteria methodology for selecting the sites of P&R lots and to carry out a developmental analysis of P&R facilities by creating the above introduced scheme for parking lots in the Vilnius City. The expert method has been used for utilizing a set of relevant criteria for planning the P&R scheme. With the help of the expert survey, the weights and significance of the defined criteria have been identified. Multi-criteria methods have been applied for calculating and presenting the developmental priorities and a strategy for the implementation of the offered proposals.\n",

      "Lake areas in urban fringes are under increasing urbanization pressure. Consequently, the conflict between rapid urban development and the maintenance of water bodies in such areas urgently needs to be addressed. An inexact chance-constrained linear programming (ICCLP) model for optimal land-use management of lake areas in urban fringes was developed. The ICCLP model was based on land-use suitability assessment and land evaluation. The maximum net economic benefit (NEB) was selected as the objective of land-use allocation. The total environmental capacity (TEC) of water systems and the public financial investment (PFI) at different probability levels were considered key constraints. Other constraints included in the model were land-use suitability, governmental requirements on the ratios of various land-use types, and technical constraints. A case study implementing the system was performed for the lake area of Hanyang at the urban fringe of Wuhan, central China, based on our previous study on land-use suitability assessment. The Hanyang lake area is under significant urbanization pressure. A 15-year optimal model for land-use allocation is proposed during 2006 to 2020 to better protect the water system and to gain the maximum benefits of development. Sixteen constraints were set for the optimal model. The model results indicated that NEB was between $1.48 x 10(9) and $8.76 x 10(9) or between $3.98 x 10(9) and $16.7 x 10(9), depending on the different urban-expansion patterns and land demands. The changes in total developed area and the land-use structure were analyzed under different probabilities (q(i) ) of TEC. Changes in q(i) resulted in different urban expansion patterns and demands on land, which were the direct result of the constraints imposed by TEC and PFI. The ICCLP model might help local authorities better understand and address complex land-use systems and develop optimal land-use management strategies that better balance urban expansion and grassland conservation.\n",

      "Transportation sectors in developing countries suffer from some diseases that one of them is ever-increasing energy consumption. Integrated National Energy Planning (INEP) in transportation sector is a solution for these countries to alter their suboptimal pattern and rationalize their energy consumption. One of the INEP targets is determining optimal patterns of fuels and transportation technologies to satisfy future demand of freight and passenger transportation at the lowest cost levels. Following the above target, this paper is concerned with the optimal consumption pattern of fuels focusing on vehicle technologies within the next 25 years (up to 2029). Using Energy Flow Optimization Model-ENVironment (EFOM-ENV) model, various steps as designing of \"Reference Energy System (RES)\" of the model, data processing and scenario analysis are followed. Based on the modeling results, substitution of urban railroad technologies (subway, LRT and monorail), all of passenger CNG technologies (cars, buses and minibuses), rural railroad freight technologies (electrical, gas oil and LNG freight trains) and finally, CNG and LNG heavy and light trucks with current passenger and freight vehicle technologies are suggested. This scenario will decline fuel consumption by about 14% totally, that the most part of it belongs to gasoline and gas oil (24% and 17%, respectively). Total discounted cost of transportation system will decline from 806.20 to 691.74 billion dollars (14%) during the time horizon. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

Approximately 25-30 tons of health-care wastes, in addition to the domestic and recyclable wastes, are generated from hospitals, clinics and other small health-care institutions daily on the European and the Asian sides of Istanbul [Kocasoy, G., Topkaya, B., Zeren, B.A., Kilic, M., et al., 2004.

Determination of the Health-care Waste Handling and Final Disposal of the Infected Waste of Hospital-Medical Centers in the Anatolian Side of istanbul. M.S. Thesis, Bogazici University, istanbul, Turkey]. Unfortunately, these wastes are not handled, collected or temporarily stored at the institutions properly according to the published Turkish Medical Waste Control Regulation [Ministry of Environment and Forestry, 2005. Medical Waste Control Regulation. Official Gazette No. 25883, Ankara, Turkey]. Besides the inappropriate handling at the institutions, there is no systematic program for the transportation of the health-care wastes to the final disposal sites. The transportation of these wastes is realized by the vehicles of the municipalities in an uncontrolled, very primitive way. As a consequence, these improperly managed health-care wastes cause many risks to the public health and people who handle them. This study has been conducted to develop a health-care waste collection and transportation system for the city of istanbul, Turkey. Within the scope of the study, the collection of health-care wastes from the temporary storage rooms of the health-care institutions, transportation of these wastes to the final disposal areas and the cost-benefit analyses of the existing and the proposed optimum transportation routes are investigated and the most feasible routes from the point of view of efficiency and economy have been determined. In order to solve the scheduling and route optimization problem, special software programs called MapInfo, and Roadnet were used. For the program, the geocodes of hospital locations, data about the amount of the health-care wastes generated, the loading and unloading process times, and the capacity of the collecting vehicles were taken into account. The new systems developed aim at the daily collection of the health-care wastes from the institutions and their transportation directly to the final disposal area/facility by using the shortest and the most efficient routes to resolve the routing and scheduling problem and to reduce the cost arising from the transportation.

Fifty-four cases covering six cities (Helsinki, Berlin, Bordeaux, Rome, Jerusalem and Athens), three indoor environment categories I, II and III (according to standard EN 152512007) and three air velocities (<0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 m/s) were simulated. The required cooling/heating energy was calculated assuming a perfectly efficient HVAC system. A cooling energy saving between 17 and 48% and a reduction of the maximum cooling power in the range 10-28% has been obtained. The results reveal that the required power input of the fan is a critical factor for achieving energy saving at elevated room temperature. Under the assumptions of this study, the energy saving may not be achieved with the methods for air speed increase, such as ceiling, standing, tower and desk fans widely used today when the power consumption of the fan is higher than 20 W.

      "This paper calculates the benefits of the Advanced Integrated Rail Service in Lima, Peru. The service consists of the application of five new intelligent transportation systems to rail transit managed from an advanced marketing and information center. These systems provide (a) advanced passenger information, (b) optimized productivity of roads that access rail stations and their capacities, (c) improved rail transfers, (d) advanced taxi-rail service, and (e) advanced parking management. The new service can produce benefits by improving the quality of rail travel, increasing the productivity of taxis, and optimizing the productivity of roads that access rail stations and their capacities. The benefits include the reduction of three cost items: (a) transport user costs (time, monetary, and vehicle operating costs), (b) the cost required to operate the system (fuel subsidies to stabilize the effect of the variability in oil prices), and (c) the cost of externalities (health impacts, the cost of accidents, social costs, and the cost from carbon emissions). The benefits are estimated by the use of transportation planning software with data from the urban transportation master plan for the period from 2005 to 2025. As a result, the new rail service can produce considerable benefits. These are derived from the transfer of passengers from automobiles and taxis to rail for a segment of their trip, but it can also produce negative but smaller effects derived from the shift of traffic from faster highways to the slower roads that access rail stations. The advanced integrated rail service can foster rail ridership, increase average speeds in the city, and reduce fuel subsidies.\n",

      "Transportation is a major user of carbon-based fuels and is increasingly being highlighted as the sector that contributes the least to carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emission reduction targets. This paper reports on the findings of the current Visioning and Backcasting for Transport in London study, which considers the role of the transportation sector in reducing CO(2) emissions in London. A backcasting study approach was used, and the likely impacts of alternative images of 2025 were tested. A transportation and carbon simulation game was also developed for London. Within this game, users are able to consider a series of potential policy packages, such as low-emission vehicles, alternative fuels, pricing regimens, public transportation, walking and cycling, strategic and local urban planning, information and communication technologies, smarter choices, ecological driving and slower speeds, long-distance travel substitution, freight transportation, and international air, and select various levels of application to help achieve headline CO(2) emissions reduction targets. The roles of two external enabling measures, carbon rationing and oil pricing, were also considered. The paper considers an optimized policy package for 2025. A deep reduction in CO(2) emissions from the transportation sector is theoretically possible, yet difficult to achieve. The main perceived problem is in engendering an interest in the public to change consumer purchases and behaviors. The huge challenge now is to map out and discuss a variety of policy pathways to carbon efficiency in the transportation sector and then to enable and achieve a level of consumer and behavioral change consistent with strategic aspiration.\n",

      "Problem: Transit-oriented development has been shown to be socially desirable for a variety of reasons, but little is known about the benefits it provides to individual residents. Purpose: We used a natural experiment to better understand the value of convenient transit access to individuals. Methods: We queried 51 residents of a revitalizing, mixed-use, Salt Lake City neighborhood near the TRAX light rail line about their behaviors and attitudes, classifying them into three groups: nonriders; new riders, who reported recent rail rides only after the stop opened; and continuing riders, who reported recent rail rides both before and after the new stop opened. Participants wore accelerometers and completed surveys during two different time periods, one before and one after a new light rail stop opened in their neighborhood. Results and conclusions: Adjusted for income and employment, obesity was much higher among nonriders (65%) than new riders (26%) and continuing riders (15%). All other significant differences show the same pattern, with new riders' averages lying between the extremes of nonriders and continuing riders. Continuing riders had, on average, the largest number of moderate physical activity bouts, and reported the highest place attachment, the greatest neighborhood satisfaction, the most favorable attitudes toward transit-oriented development, took the fewest car rides, and had the least pro-suburban attitudes. New riders reported fewer car rides after the rail service started. The other group-by-time univariate interactions and the multivariate time main effect were insignificant. Takeaway for practice: Development with convenient transit access may provide benefits to individuals as well as improving societal sustainability. Planners may want to promote the personal benefits associated with living in transit-oriented development and rail use, including high levels of neighborhood satisfaction and place attachment among riders. Walkable designs, density bonuses, and signage or other methods of orienting transit riders to destinations within walking distance of stops may enable obese residents or others who are especially sensitive to walking distances to use rail.

      "This article examines the future role of energy efficiency as a resource in the Western US and Canada, as envisioned in the most recent resource plans issued by 16 utilities, representing about 60% of the region's load. Utility and third-party-administered energy-efficiency programs proposed by 15 utilities over a 10-year horizon would save almost 19,000 GWh annually, about 5.2% of forecast load. There are clear regional trends in the aggressiveness of proposed energy savings. California's investor-owned utilities (IOUs) had the most aggressive savings targets, followed by IOUs in the Pacific Northwest, and the lowest savings were proposed by utilities in Inland West states and by two public utilities on the West Coast. The adoption of multiple, aggressive policies targeting energy efficiency and climate change appears to produce sizeable energy-efficiency commitments. Certain specific policies, such as mandated energy savings goals for California's IOUs and energy-efficiency provisions in Nevada's Renewable Portfolio Standard, had a direct impact on the level of energy savings included in the resource plans. Other policies, such as revenue decoupling and shareholder incentives and voluntary or legislatively mandated greenhouse gas emission reduction policies, may have also impacted utilities' energy-efficiency commitments, though the effects of these policies are not easily measured. Despite progress among the utilities in our sample, more aggressive energy-efficiency strategies that include high-efficiency standards for additional appliances and equipment, tighter building codes for new construction and renovation, as well as more comprehensive ratepayer-funded energy-efficiency programs are likely to be necessary to achieve a region-wide goal of meeting 20% of electricity demand with efficiency in 2020.\n",

      "Heritage trees (HTs) play pertinent ecological-landscaping roles in cities, yet the few known studies are mainly descriptive or resource inventories. This paper explores the intertwined natural and cultural spatial associations between trees (species, dimensions and age) and city (landscape impact, urban fabric, district history and landuse), assessing the integrated city-tree complex at the macro-scale. The study area includes eight main built-up districts (covering 116 km 2) of Guangzhou, a compact and major city in South China. A survey of historical and inventory records identified 348 HTs which encompass the city's officially recognized HTs. Principal component analysis (PCA), Jaccard Index of Similarity (JIS), and other statistical tests helped to unravel spatial associations. The 25 HT species, compared to 254 species in the city's entire urban forest, are dominated by four common species. The number of HTs increases with district age of 25-2500 years. The more stressful and cramped roadside habitat accommodates more HTs, followed by spacious park, and intra-lot interstitial spaces in education, government-institution, and religious sites. The HTs are dominated by the 100-200-year age bracket, with few older trees, indicating a generation gap and the inability of old districts to preserve older trees. Park and religious sites accommodate more of the oldest and largest trees. Roadside contains more wide-crown trees mainly due to effective protection from motor vehicles by the inner bicycle lane. District is indicated by JIS as the major determinant of species variations, with landuse playing a secondary role. Large trees polarise into normal and degraded tree forms due to physical site constraints. Tall-wide and short-wide tree forms with high landscape impact contribution dominate landscape impacts. PCA extracted three factors that explained 71.9% of the variations, namely age-dimension, potential growth, and district history. Increasing compactness and the present management regime may fail to sustain the HT stock and deprive the city of HT precursors. The concept of ecological brinkmanship and transgenerational arboriculture are proposed to enhance HT conservation. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

A particular focus is given to coagulation-flocculation, chemical precipitation, ammonium stripping, membrane filtration and adsorption. The advantages and limitations of various techniques are evaluated. Their operating conditions such as pH, dose required, characteristics of leachate in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and NH3-N concentration and treatment efficiency are compared. It is evident from the survey of 118 papers (1983-2005) that none of the individual physico-chemical techniques is universally applicable or highly effective for the removal of recalcitrant compounds from stabilized leachate. Among the treatments reviewed in this article, adsorption, membrane filtration and chemical precipitation are the most frequently applied and studied worldwide. Both activated carbon adsorption and nanofiltration are effective for over 95% COD removal with COD concentrations ranging from 5690 to 17,000mg/L. About 98% removal of NH3-N with an initial concentration ranging from 3260 to 5618 mg/L has been achieved using struvite precipitation. A combination of physico-chemical and biological treatments has demonstrated its effectiveness for the treatment of stabilized leachate. Almost complete removal of COD and NH3-N has been accomplished by a combination of reverse osmosis (RO) and an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) with an initial COD concentration of 35,000 mg/L and NH3-N concentration of 1600 mg/L and/or RO and activated sludge with an initial COD concentration of 6440 mg/L and NH3-N concentration of 1153 mg/L. It is important to note that the selection of the most suitable treatment method for landfill leachate depends on the characteristics of landfill leachate, technical applicability and constraints, effluent discharge alternatives, cost-effectiveness, regulatory requirements and environmental impact.

For all scenarios it is expected that there will be significant traffic growth. Traffic growth is restricted most in scenarios including distance-based road charging on motorways and trunk roads. However, congestion and carbon dioxide emissions are most effectively limited in scenarios with congestion-based road charging, major improvements to urban public transport and investment in new fuel technologies and in improving engine efficiency.

This paper takes the inter-city passenger transport in China as a case, and develops a system dynamics model for policy assessment and CO2 mitigation potential analysis. It is found that the future demand for China's inter-city passenger transport is expected to be large, with the turnover volume growing at a rate of 9% per annum and amounting to 6600 billion p-km in 2020. Major emissions reduction potential exists in inter-city passenger transport. In 2020, comparing to the case without any specific policies stressing mitigation, the reduction Of CO2 emissions ranges from 26% to 32% under those scenarios with policy controls.

      "While cities are considered to be inherently unsustainable, these urban human settlements will be where a majority of the population will be living in the next two to three decades. Among the ten largest cities in the world in terms of population sizes, three are in Southeast Asia alone and more than one in two people will be living in cities in 2025. These primate cities - Metro-Manila in the Philippines, Jakarta in Indonesia and Bangkok in Thailand - are seeing not only rapid rates of in-migration but also rapid expansion and urban sprawl. Such rapid rates of change pose growing challenges to Southeast Asian cities including smaller capital cities like Kuala Lumpur, Ho Chi Minh City and Singapore. The strongest challenge concern infrastructural provision and particularly that provided for urban transport and mobility. Urban traffic congestion is an issue that is common to most Southeast Asian cities including Singapore which has introduced relatively draconian policy measures to both contain the level of car ownership and the use of the car. A comparison with several European cities highlight where Southeast Asian cities can review their own urban transport policies. This paper focuses on the lessons that can be learnt from a comparative study of the infrastructural provision and public policies that are in place in Southeast Asian and European cities.\n",

      "Utilizing the earth and near-grade environment as a Source of energy has historically been a common practice. Beyond solar and wind, designers do not usually look towards the sky as the Source of additional benefits. The objective of this paper was to make tall-building designers more aware of the additional Sources Of sustainability 'in the sky'; how these sources change with altitude; and how this knowledge can benefit the design, construction and operation of tall buildings. Exterior environmental factors including temperature, presssure/air density, solar, wind and moisture, and their relationships with altitude are discussed. Selected approaches are suggested on how to benefit from them. Since current energy codes and green building standards do not address the issue of enrironmental variations with attitude, the sky has potential to offer Unique energy-saving opportunities and possibly add to the quantified sustainability of a tall building. Where possible, a speculative 1-km (3281 ft) tall tower in Dubai is used as an example for illustration. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Soils, Ltd.\n",

      "Forecasting urban futures is of great importance to ensure the adequate provision of public and private services and to implement policies that guide demand while mitigating negative impacts. This study produces year 2030 predictions of land use and travel conditions across the Austin-Round Rock statistical metropolitan area of Texas by integrating a gravity-based land use model (modeled on Putman's Integrated Transportation-Land Use Package specification) with a standard travel demand model. The land use model cycles through job, household, and land consumption estimates across traffic analysis zones before feeding forward into a contemporaneous model of travel patterns. To understand the implications of different policies better, three scenarios were generated: a business-as-usual scenario, a congestion pricing plus carbon tax scenario, and an urban growth boundary (UGB) scenario. Results reveal how these transportation and land use policies may shape our land and travel futures, and they illuminate challenges and pitfalls of the gravity-based approach to land use (including the accompanying land consumption model). Of particular interest is that the imposition of road pricing (roughly 5(sic)/mi) had almost no discernable effect on land use predictions, yet resulted in the same predicted reduction in regional vehicle miles traveled as the UGB policy (roughly 15%).\n",

      "This paper reports the results of a study on residential parcel design and development-induced stormwater runoff in the City of Madison, Wisconsin. To assess the influence of municipal zoning and subdivision regulations on residential stormwater production, high-resolution aerial photography and property tax data for over 38000 single-family residential parcels were used to measure the impervious cover and modeled runoff associated with a typical two-year storm. The results of the analysis suggest that stormwater runoff volumes could be significantly reduced with only modest changes to municipal land-development regulations and with no reduction in the size of the residential structure. Following the presentation of the methodology and findings, the paper concludes with a discussion of targeted revisions to zoning and subdivision regulations that, if implemented, could reduce the runoff volume from new residential parcels in Madison by over 30%.\n",

      "Passive houses offer extended living comfort with only 15-20% of the space heating demand of conventional new buildings while the extra costs of this standard are only about 10% of the total building costs. In the first part of this paper, detailed measurements for 11 \"Passive House\" projects with more than 100 dwelling units from the EU-funded demonstration project CEPHEUS (Cost Efficient Passive Houses as European Standards) are presented. All projects exhibit extraordinarily low space heat consumptions. Compared with ordinary, newly erected buildings, 80% of the space heat consumption could be saved. The total primary energy consumption (including household electricity) was less than 50% of that of conventional new buildings. The measurements show that the buildings also offer comfortable indoor conditions in both summer and winter. Several social research studies revealed that the users are well pleased with their homes. The second part of the paper focuses on low-income tenant's satisfaction in the world's first multi-story Passive Houses in Kassel, Germany. This building contrasts sharply with the \"standard\" Passive House, occupied by its owners. A 2.5 year study was conducted from spring of 2000 to autumn of 2002. The development of opinions, attitudes, behaviour, and satisfaction over time could be recorded. The building is a clear success, the tenant's satisfaction is high. It is concluded that this building type fulfils the conditions of sustainability in social, ecological and economic respects and should therefore be disseminated on a larger scale. To this end, the last part of the paper describes the development of the Passive House standard in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, from the first demonstration project in 1991 to about 3500 dwelling units today. The prerequisites for this development are analysed. Finally, the authors give their view about the political possibilities for pushing Passive Houses into the market as well as for stimulating a market pull for this comfortable and energy efficient building type.

      "Background: The Task Force on Community Preventive Services strongly recommends environmental interventions that include enhanced access to opportunities for physical activity, such as walking and cycling trails. Although accumulating evidence indicates that trails can be effective in increasing physical activity, little is known about trail users. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of a national sample of 3717 adults from the HealthStyles and ConsumerStyles surveys using logistic regression to determine physical activity patterns and sociodemographic correlates related to trail use, and to identify support regarding trail development policies. Results: Almost 13% (12.7%) of the sample reported using trails at least once a month and 24.3% at least once a week. People who reported using trails at least once a week were twice as likely than people who reported rarely or never using trails to meet physical activity recommendations (odds ratio = 2.3, 95% confidence interval = 1.9-2.8). Nearly half (43.6%) of the non-trail users supported expanded public spaces for people to exercise, and 36.4% of the non-trail users reported that they would be willing to pay more taxes to build more parks and trails in their community. Conclusions: Community trails facilitate physical activity, and almost half of frequent trail users report that access to trails and other green space is important in choosing a place to live. These results support the need for prospective research on whether newly built trails promote physical activity in previously inactive people.\n",

      "The retromer complex is involved in the retrograde transport of the CI-M6PR (cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor) from endosomes to the Golgi. It is a hetero-trimeric complex composed of Vps26 (vacuolar sorting protein 26), Vps29 and Vps35 proteins, which are conserved in eukaryote evolution. Recently, elucidation of the crystal structure of Vps29 revealed that Vps29 contains a metallo-phosphoesterase fold [Wang, Guo, Liang, Fan, Zhu, Zang, Zhu, Li, Teng, Niu et al. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 22962-22967; Collins, Skinner, Watson, Seaman and Owen (2005) Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 12, 594-602]. We demonstrate that recombinant hVps29 (human Vps29) displays in vitro phosphatase activity towards a serine-phosphorylated peptide, containing the acidic-cluster dileucine motif of the cytoplasmatic tail of the CI-M6PR. Efficient dephosphorylation required the additional presence of recombinant hVps26 and hVps35 proteins, which interact with hVps29. Phosphatase activity of hVps29 was greatly decreased by alanine substitutions of active-site residues that are predicted to co-ordinate metal ions. Using inductively coupled plasma MS, we demonstrate that recombinant hVps29 binds zinc. Moreover, hVps29-dependent phosphatase activity is greatly reduced by non-specific and zinc-specific metal ion chelators, which can be completely restored by addition of excess ZnCl2. The binuclear Zn2+ centre and phosphate group were modelled into the hVps29 catalytic site and pK(a), calculations provided further insight into the molecular mechanisms of Vps29 phosphatase activity. We conclude that the retromer complex displays Vps29-dependent in vitro phosphatase activity towards a serinephosphorylated acidic-cluster dileucine motif that is involved in endosomal trafficking of the CI-M6PR. The potential significance of these findings with respect to regulation of transport of cycling trans-Golgi network proteins is discussed.\n",

      "One goal of the Swedish energy policy is to reduce the amount of electricity used for heating in the building sector. This means to reduce the primary energy used for heating which in this paper is analyzed in the context of various heating technologies and CO2 emissions. The analysis is applied to a region in Sweden (southern Sweden) for which detailed information on the energy infrastructure (the capital stock of the buildings and heating systems together with geographical variations in heat intensity) is available from a previous work [Johansson, P., Nylander, A., Johnsson, F., 2005. Electricity dependency and CO2 emissions from heating in the Swedish building sector-current trends in conflict with governmental policy? Energy policy] and which is large enough to be assumed representative for Sweden as a whole. The detailed mapping of the energy infrastructure allows a good estimate on the rate at which the energy system can be expected to be replaced with respect to economical lifetime of the capital stock (the year 2025 in this case). Two scenarios are investigated; a: target scenario for which energy savings are employed (e.g. improving climate shell in buildings) and oil and most of the electricity used for heating purposes are phased out and a second for which the current trend in the heating market continues.In the target scenario it is shown that although only applying commercially competitive heating technologies, it is possible to achieve a 47% reduction in primary energy use for heating with a 34% decrease in heat demand together with significant reduction in CO2 emissions. However, the scenario which continues the current trends on the heating market instead yields an increase (of about 10%) in primary energy use (reduction in conversion efficiency) of the heating system of the region over the period studied, in spite of a slight decrease in heat demand (9%, mainly due to energy efficiency measures) as well as in CO2 emissions. In light of the recently proposed introduction of energy performance certification of buildings in Sweden (and in EU), it can be concluded that such a certification system must take into account the primary energy use and local conditions. A politically acceptable way to do so would be to propose municipalities to develop \"best strategies\" on development of the heating market for various house types and districts within the municipality which can then be included as recommendations in the energy performance certification of the buildings.

      "Wasatch Choices 2040 was a partnership between Envision Utah and the two major metropolitan planning organizations along Utah's Wasatch Front. The purpose of the partnership was to involve the public through a scenario planning process and to consider the role of land use in developing the region's long-range transportation plan. Through :13 public workshops and 5 open houses held in 2005, members of the public expressed their preferences for transportation and land use in their communities. The input from the public informed the development of regional growth principles that have since been adopted by elected officials and will guide transportation and land use decisions in Wasatch Front communities. In addition, results from the public process were used to create four regional transportation and land use scenarios that ultimately led to the creation of a regional vision. Each scenario was tested by using the CentreSim forecasting model, and a vision scenario was created to depict one version of how the Wasatch Front could develop if guided by regional growth principles. Modeling of the regional vision demonstrates that it performs significantly better than the existing long-range plan for several quality-of-life measures, including traffic congestion. This process proved groundbreaking by reminding both land use and transportation professionals that futures cannot be planned in isolation. Transportation affects land use just as much as land use affects transportation. It is a circular relationship that must be accounted for. This process focuses on bringing all interests to the table concurrently to plan for a better future.\n",

      "There are numerous mid-sized cities in the developing world and most of them lack effective urban management and transportation policies. Though city efforts to reduce global warming potential (GWP) emissions may be low in the global context, effective transportation policies in cities will have obvious results. Taking the Kathmandu Valley as a case study, this paper makes an attempt to analyse the implication of different transportation policies for reducing vehicular emissions and energy consumption. This paper estimates and analyses current and future trends of energy demand and environmental emissions, especially CO2 and PM10 from passenger road transportation in the Kathmandu Valley. The study is based on the primary data collected at the busiest and longest inner city road. It uses the long range energy alternatives planning system framework to construct future scenarios up to 2025. It analyses future scenario implications mainly dealing with the introduction of trolley buses, promotion of public transportation, discouraging private vehicles and low occupancy public vehicles, increasing vehicular speed, and other transportation policies. The study estimated that the 637 million passenger-kilometres traveled in the study route during 2004 resulted in 34.8 million kg of CO2 emissions. The travel demand is estimated to multiply by 7.8 with a corresponding twelve-fold increase in CO2 emissions and a ten-fold increase in total suspended particles (TSP) emissions in the study route from 2004 to 2024 under a non-intervention scenario. This scenario analysis suggests that discouraging private vehicles, thereby promoting mass transportation operated by electricity, can reduce CO2 by 43.7% and TSP by 43.8% compared with a scenario of non-intervention. In addition to transportation policies, effective land-use planning and encouragement of non-motorised transport can have more positive impacts. Since Nepal is the Himalayan Kingdom, having many glaciers and snow-fed rivers, it is in great risk of global warming. Therefore change should begin immediately.\n",

The results showed that the increase in residential energy consumption in Japan is mainly caused by the widespread use of heating equipment, hot water supply apparatus, and other household electrical appliances. On the other hand, it was indicated that the increase in commercial energy use is mainly due to the increase of the floor area of buildings, particularly hotels, hospitals, and department stores.

      "There is a need to recognize the difficulties experienced in managing waste and to understand the reasons for those difficulties, especially in developing countries such as Jordan. Zarqa is a Governorate located in central Jordan, which has 2874 registered industries, making up more than 52% of the total industries in the country. Zarqa Governorate suffers from serious solid waste problems. These problems arise from an absence of adequate policies, facilitating legislation, and an environmentally enthused public, which therefore have a negative impact on the environment and health. Solid waste generation in Zarqa Governorate has increased exponentially and has polluted natural resources and the environment. A significant change in municipal solid waste generation was evident between the years 1994 and 2000. The Zarqa Governorate generated 482 tons/day in 2002 with a per capita rate of 0.44 kg/cap-day [Consulting Engineers, 2002, Feasibility study for the treatment of industrial wastewater in Zarqa Governorate. A project funded by METAP and Zarqa Chamber of Industry. Unpublished report]. This manuscript assesses the current operational and management practices of solid waste in the Zarqa Governorate; and evaluates the associated issues of solid waste collection, storage, transport, disposal and recycling in developing countries. The lack of techniques, financial funds and awareness among public and private sectors form an obstacle for achieving a successful environmental program. Several options are proposed to address management goals. Although Jordan became the first country in the Middle East to adopt a national environmental strategy; waste disposal is still largely uncontrolled and large quantities of waste go uncollected. Ensuring proper management of solid wastes, enforcing regulations, and implementing proper environmental awareness programs that will enhance the public understanding and achieve greater efficiency, are the findings of this study.

      "Lack of water management in the Sana'a Basin in Yemen has led to mining of groundwater and massive groundwater quality deterioration. In the last four years, management of waste water has changed dramatically and entire city neighborhoods have been connected to a conventional sewer system. In this paper, the effects of this measure on long-term groundwater quality development of the aquifers underlying Sana'a and, more specifically, on water quality of the public supply peri-urban wellfields are analyzed. The results, obtained with a transient groundwater model, indicated that by 2020 the construction of the sewerage will have considerably reduced the area polluted by groundwater, but the process is slow. Furthermore, construction of the sewerage will hardly affect the groundwater quality of the wellfields, since flow is not directed towards most of the production wells. The Yemeni authorities should realize that less expensive sanitation alternatives are available, but they need user participation, which, in turn, would raise public awareness that water supplies and sanitation are not to be seen as solely a government responsibility.\n",

      "This paper investigates the risk of projected post-2050s overheating in existing, retrofitted and new-build dwellings in the United Kingdom. As shown in the previous research, passive measures may not be sufficient in mitigating overheating risk. Therefore, mechanical cooling technologies that may be deployed to adapt' to a warming climate are tested for energy and CO2 implications. For retrofits, heating demand is projected to remain dominant, whereas in post-2016 new-build, greater cooling system efficiency will be important. Thermal mass is shown to reduce future cooling load. The heat recovery element of mechanical ventilation with heat recovery may be rendered unnecessary in super-efficient homes. Ceiling fans coupled with natural ventilation may be sufficient in providing thermal comfort in the north of England. Ultimately, not planning for future overheating and cooling systems could create a new performance gap in design, construction and occupant behaviour. Practical application: Overheating, already experienced in dwellings throughout the United Kingdom and projected to increase in occurrence, should be considered in all new design and retrofit. Dwellings designed to meet thermal comfort performance targets may be at risk of non-compliance as a result of a warming climate. Furthermore, dwellings designed to meet energy performance targets may be at risk of non-compliance as a result of potential need for cooling systems. The findings have implications for policy-making in relation to decarbonisation of the electricity grid, implementation of the Green Deal and upgrading building regulations to future-proof new and existing housing against a warming climate.\n",

      "Personal travel time in U.S. urban areas has been stable, clashing with the assertion that urban sprawl greatly lengthens travel. Average commute time rises by 7.7 percent with each cross-sectional doubling of Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) jobs. Using the RELU-TRAN structural computable general equilibrium model of the Chicago MSA, we simulate the equilibrium effects of a 24 percent population increase projected from 2000 to 2030 by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning. If no new road capacity is added, then congestion per mile increases. Although the urbanized land area increases by 19 percent, indicating sprawl, the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per car-trip decreases by 1.31 percent and the VMT per car-trip to work decreases by 2.78 percent. Car travel time increases by only 6.25 percent and commuting time by only 4.54 percent, from 30.3 minutes in 2000 to 31.7 in 2030 or 3.4 seconds per year. We further explore the effects of new road capacity, gasoline prices, public transit speed, fuel economy gains, limits on suburban construction, and importantly, the cross-elasticity of public transit use with respect to car times. The availability of public transportation, economizing on nonwork travel, and land use adjustments that increase job-residence proximity keep times stable.\n",

      "From an ecological point of view, the reduction of the \"consumption\" of energy is the first aim. The reduction of the CO2-emissions is only a subsidiary aim. On the other hand in industry, the reduction of the costs for energy is the main motive power to increase the efficiency of energy use.Therefore, efficiency may be interpreted in different ways and the understanding of efficiency is led by different criteria. Nevertheless, from a scientifical point of view, an efficient use of energy means the minimization of the input energy for a given energy application. This objective definition has been applied in the German directive for the evaluation of the efficient use of heat in buildings within the \"Energie-Einspar-Verordnung 2002\" [EnEV - Verordnung fiber energiesparenden Warmeschutz and energiesparende Anlagentechnik bei Gebauden - Bundesgesetzblatt Teil I Nr. 59 vom 21.

The SEAP approach and criteria, initially considered at a general level, are then analyzed in detail with their operational consequences regarding the city. The Baseline Emission Inventory for the city, preparation of the SEAP, its implementation in the various sectors involved (buildings, renewable energy sources, transport, public policy, and others) are analyzed. Eventually, the SEAP monitoring strategy is addressed, considering assessment of the implemented actions, biennial monitoring report, and dynamic management of the CoM. In this way, a useful benchmark is provided to those facing this issue and, more generally, to those dealing with the management of energy sustainability at various levels.

      "For a 40-year horizon (1990-2030), on-road vehicle exhaust emissions were evaluated, retrospectively and prospectively, for the largest urban agglomeration in India - the Greater Delhi region with a combined population of 22 million in 2011 (Delhi along with Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida, Faridabad and Gurgaon). Emissions of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) reached their peak during late 1990s through early 2000s after which they reduced significantly through year 2012. On the other hand, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon dioxide show an increasing trend. The most reduction in emissions between 1998 and 2012 occurred as a result of implementation of four sets of vehicular emission standards, removal of lead, reduction of sulfur content, mandatory retirement of older commercial vehicles, and conversion of diesel and petrol run public transport vehicles to compressed natural gas. In addition, changes in the vehicular technology have also contributed to controlling emissions especially in case of auto-rickshaws and motorized two-wheelers, which changed from two-stroke to four-stroke. The rising trend of NOx along with the presence of VOCs indicates increasing tendency to form ground-level ozone and as a result, smog in the region. We predict that the current regime of vehicle technology, fuel standards, and high growth rate of private vehicles, is likely to nullify all the past emission reductions by the end of 2020s.

The partial and temporal influences on energy demand in each country of the number of households, floor area per household (m(2)) and unit consumption for space and water heating (kWh/m(2)/year) are disaggregated. The long-run price elasticity of demand at the unit consumption level is found to be low (around -0.25 over the four countries) while the long-run income elasticity of floor area per household is found to be around 0.25 for Italy, Sweden and the UK but insignificant for France. In an exercise using the model to estimate demand to 2050 under annual increases in energy prices of between 0% and 3% it is found that non-price effects such as building codes and autonomous technical progress (represented in the model as a time trend) are equally or more important than the price effect in reducing demand. Thus achieving significant reductions in EU residential sector energy demand by 2050 would require additional non-price policies and measures for success. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Urban population in India has increased significantly from 62 million in 1951 to 378 million in 2011 in six decades. It is estimated to reach 540 million by the year 2021. This reflects on likely pressure on urban transportation system. The situation necessarily calls plans for balanced personal and public transport system. Mandatory trips bear more importance in this regard owing to their higher share in urban trips. Mode share and their choice behaviour in estimation of such trips play vital role in analysing and boosting sustainable transportation. Logit modelling approach is the conventional method generally adopted for analysing mode choice behaviour, which is based on the principle of random utility maximization derived from econometric theory. However, such models cannot address uncertainity prevailing in the choice decisions. On the contrary, fuzzy logic bypasses the binary crisp derivations of the inputs and accepts multivalued inputs in linguistic expressions, which make possible to resemble the human behaviour closely. Therefore, the attempt here is to develop fuzzy logic based mode choice model for education trips, which constitutes a good share in mandatory trips by covering various income groups of Indian society.\n",

A four-stage systematic tracking survey of 240 households was conducted for one week in each season starting from the summer of 2011 to the spring of 2012. And the driving forces behind HSW generation were analyzed using a multiple linear regression model. Results show that Suzhou's HSW generation rate was 280.5 g/cap/day, and the annual generation of HSW reached 568 thousand tons, among which, 89.3% were compostable and recyclable waste. Education level of the household daily manager has a major impact on HSW generation rate. And other factors, such as local customs and culture, consumption patterns and residential lifestyles could also influence HSW generation. It could achieve annual economic benefit of 15.9 million RMB, reduce 32.6 million tons of CO2 equivalent emissions, and supply nearly 3500 job opportunities in Suzhou if source separation practice well.

      "This paper calculates the cost-effectiveness of CO2 emissions reduction in Brazilian buildings sector. The evaluation takes into account the implementation of three public policy mechanisms which the focus is the promotion of energy efficiency (EE). The mechanisms evaluated are minimum energy performance standards (MEPS), EE requirements in public procurement regulation, and building codes. The evaluation performed through marginal abatement cost curves (MACC) shows a wide range of cost-effective EE measures, i.e., EE technologies that represent negative abatement costs once the additional investments in EE are paid back through energy savings. The main specific findings are that (1) MEPS could be broader and reach the use of energy in standby mode and tubular fluorescent lamps and should be more stringent, mainly in the case of large air conditioning devices, and (2) there is a significant cost-effective potential of emissions reduction that could be captured through mechanisms not implemented yet in the country, as public procurement regulation and building codes. In general, the total impacts are very significant and could represent an energy saving potential of 795 TWh and emissions reduction of 74 million tons of CO2 over the period from the year 2014 to the year 2030.\n",

For the first time we assess how fuel poverty, occupants' risk perception and use of mechanical ventilation mediate the risk of mould contamination in social housing. Methods: Postal questionnaires were sent to 3867 social housing properties to collect adult risk perception, and demographic and environmental information on occupants. Participant details were linked to data pertaining to the individual properties. Multiple logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and confidence intervals while allowing for clustering of individuals coming from the same housing estate. We used Structured Equation Modelling and Goodness of Fit analysis in mediation analyses to examine the role of fuel poverty, risk perception, use of ventilation and energy efficiency. Results: Eighteen percent of our target social housing populations (671 households) were included into our study. High risk perception (score of 8-10) was associated with reduced risk of mould contamination in the bedrooms of children (OR 0.5 95% CI; 03-0.9) and adults (OR 0.4 95% CI; 03-0.7). High risk perception of living with inadequate heating and ventilation reduced the risk of mould contamination (OR 0.5 95% CI; 03-0.8 and OR 0.5 95% CI; 0.3-0.7, respectively). Participants living with inadequate heating and not heating due to the cost of fuel had an increased risk of mould contamination (OR 3.4 95% CI; 2.0-5.8 and OR 2.2 95%CI; 1.5-3.2, respectively). Increased risk perception and use of extractor fans did not mediate the association between fuel poverty behaviours and increased risk of mould contamination. Discussion: Fuel poverty behaviours increased the risk of mould contamination, which corresponds with existing literature. For the first time we used mediation analysis to assess how this association maybe modified by occupant behaviours. Increased risk perception and use of extractor fans did not modify the association between fuel poverty and mould contamination. This suggests that fuel poor populations may not benefit from energy efficiency interventions due to ineffective heating and ventilation practices of those occupants residing participating households. Our findings may be modified by a complex interaction between occupant behaviours and the built environment. We found that participant age, occupancy, SES, pets, drying washing indoors, geographic location, architectural design/age of the property, levels of insulation and type of heating regulated risk of mould contamination. Conclusion: Fuel poverty behaviours affected around a third of participating households and represent a risk factor for increased exposures to damp and mouldy conditions, regardless of adult risk perception, heating and ventilation practices. This requires multidisciplinary approach to assess the complex interaction between occupant behaviours, risk perception, the built environment and the effective use of heating and ventilation practices. Study implications: Our findings have implications for housing policies and future housing interventions. Effective communication strategies focusing on awareness and perception of risk may help address indoor air quality issues. This must be supported by improved household energy efficiency with the provision of more effective heating and ventilation strategies, specifically to help alleviate those suffering from fuel poverty.

      "The electricity consumption in the buildings sector has been steadily increasing during the last decade, up to the point that energy efficiency in this sector has become a major problem for governments, utilities, customers, and the environment. The foreseen high penetration of distributed micro-generation facilities based on renewables can help to reduce the environmental footprint of buildings and households, although the complexity of managing effectively the electric grid increases dramatically under these conditions. The IEEE 2030 standard for interoperability in the Smart Grid remarks upon the importance of well-defined data models in such complex scenarios and puts emphasis on the benefits of ontologies and OWL (Web Ontology Language) for this purpose. This paper presents an OWL-based ontology that formally defines the vocabulary and taxonomy and captures the engineering and business semantics of this domain of knowledge (i.e., energy efficiency in the so-called nZEN - nearly Zero-Energy Neighborhoods). This ontology has been defined under the scope of the EU (European Union) research project ENERsip. The paper also highlights the main benefits the ontology brought to all the phases of the project life cycle, as well as how future work can make the most out of it. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

      "Evaluating transport policy for cities in developing countries is often constrained by data availability that limits the use of conventional appraisal models. Here, we present a new 'bottom-up' methodology to estimate transport CO2 emission from daily urban passenger travel for Beijing, a megacity with relatively sparse data on travel behaviour. A spatial microsimulation, based on an activity diary survey and two sample population censuses, is used to simulate, for Beijing's urban districts, a realistic synthetic population, and their daily travel and CO2 emission over 2000-2010. This approach provides greater insight into the spatial variability of transport CO2 emission than has previously been possible for Beijing, and further, enables an examination of the role of socio-demographics, urban form and transport developments in contributing to emissions over the modelled period. Using the 2000-2010 CO2 emission estimates as a baseline, CO2 emissions from passenger travel are then modelled to 2030 under scenarios exploring politically plausible strategies on transport (public transport infrastructure investment, and vehicle constraint), urban development (compaction) and vehicle technology (faster adoption of clean vehicle technology). The results showed that, compared to the trend scenario, employing both transport and urban development policies could reduce total passenger CO2 emission to 2030 by 24%, and by 43% if all strategies were applied together. The study reveals the potential of microsimulation in emission estimation for large cities in developing countries where data availability may constrain more traditional approaches.

      "The construction of South Korean High-Speed Rail (HSR) or Korea Train eXpress (KTX) has been evolving in phases since its first operation in 2004. This development raises concerns whether the benefits from the extended HSR network would again be limited to the initial HSR corridors and will deepen the inequalities in accessibility with the rising issue of uneven regional development of the country. This paper measures the accessibility of each stage of HSR network extension and evaluates its spatial distribution, variation, and changes using weighted averaged travel time and potential accessibility indicators. The results of this study find different accessibility impacts from each stage of HSR extension. Although travel-time reduction and increased attractions have been widened in more cities by each HSR extension, the spatial equity is degenerated by the extension in 2010/2011 as the improvement of accessibility has been concentrated in cities along the primary HSR corridor near the already-advantageous Seoul capital area. In contrast, the future HSR extension in 2018 will enhance equitable accessibility to the isolated regions such as the northeast and the southwest regions of the country. However, the relative degree of accessibility improvement will not be large enough for increasing the spatial equity of accessibility without more extended HSR networks between provinces.

      "Background: Pedometers have become common place in physical activity promotion, yet little information exists on who is using them. The multi-strategy, community-based 10,000 Steps Rockhampton physical activity intervention trial provided an opportunity to examine correlates of pedometer use at the population level. Methods: Pedometer use was promoted across all intervention strategies including: local media, pedometer loan schemes through general practice, other health professionals and libraries, direct mail posted to dog owners, walking trail signage, and workplace competitions. Data on pedometer use were collected during the 2-year follow-up telephone interviews from random population samples in Rockhampton, Australia, and a matched comparison community (Mackay). Logistic regression analyses were used to determine the independent influence of interpersonal characteristics and program exposure variables on pedometer use. Results: Data from 2478 participants indicated that 18.1% of Rockhampton and 5.6% of Mackay participants used a pedometer in the previous 18-months. Rockhampton pedometer users (n = 222) were more likely to be female ( OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.11, 2.23), aged 45 or older ( OR = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.16, 2.46) and to have higher levels of education ( university degree OR = 4.23, 95% CI: 1.86, 9.6). Respondents with a BMI > 30 were more likely to report using a pedometer ( OR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.11, 2.54) than those in the healthy weight range. Compared with those in full-time paid work, respondents in 'home duties' were significantly less likely to report pedometer use ( OR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.06, 0.53). Exposure to individual program components, in particular seeing 10,000 Steps street signage and walking trails or visiting the website, was also significantly associated with greater pedometer use. Conclusion: Pedometer use varies between population subgroups, and alternate strategies need to be investigated to engage men, people with lower levels of education and those in full-time 'home duties', when using pedometers in community-based physical activity promotion initiatives.\n",

      "With rapid economic growth and massive urbanization in China, many cities face the problem of municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal. With the lack of space for new landfills, waste-to-energy incineration is playing an increasingly important role in waste management. Incineration of MSW from Chinese cities presents some unique challenges because of its low calorific value (3000-6700 kJ/kg) and high water content (similar to 50%). This study reports a novel waste-to-energy incineration technology based on co-firing of MSW with coal in a grate-circulating fluidized bed (CFB) incinerator, which was implemented in the Changchun MSW power plant. In 2006, two 260 ton/day incinerators incinerated 137 325 tons, or approximately one/sixth of the MSW generated in Changchun, saving more than 0.2 million m(3) landfill space. A total of 46.2 million kWh electricity was generated (38 473 tons lignite was also burned as supplementary fuel), with an overall fuel-to-electricity efficiency of 14.6%. Emission of air pollutants including particulate matters, acidic gases, heavy metals, and dioxins was low and met the emission standards for incinerators. As compared to imported incineration systems, this new technology has much lower capital and operating costs and is expected to play a role in meeting China's demands for MSW disposal and alternative energy.\n",

      "The \"Positive Action for Today's Health\" (PATH) trial tested an environmental intervention to increase walking in underserved communities. Three matched communities were randomized to a police-patrolled walking plus social marketing, a police-patrolled walking-only, or a no-walking intervention. The 24-month intervention addressed safety and access for physical activity (PA) and utilized social marketing to enhance environmental supports for PA. African-Americans (N = 434; 62 % females; aged 51 +/- 16 years) provided accelerometry and psychosocial measures at baseline and 12, 18, and 24 months. Walking attendance and trail use were obtained over 24 months. There were no significant differences across communities over 24 months for moderate-to-vigorous PA. Walking attendance in the social marketing community showed an increase from 40 to 400 walkers per month at 9 months and sustained similar to 200 walkers per month through 24 months. No change in attendance was observed in the walking-only community. Findings support integrating social marketing strategies to increase walking in underserved African-Americans (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT01025726).\n",

      "Although urban growth in the city of Glasgow, UK, has subsided, urban morphology continues to generate local heat islands. We present a relatively less data-intense method to classify local climate zones (La) and evaluate the effectiveness of green infrastructure options in tackling the likely overheating problem in cold climate urban agglomerations such as the Glasgow Clyde Valley (GCV) Region. LCZ classification uses LIDAR data available with local authorities, based on the typology developed by Stewart and Oke (2012). La classes were then used cluster areas likely to exhibit similar warming trends locally. This helped to identify likely problem areas, a sub-set of which were then modelled for the effect of green cover options (both increase and reduction in green cover) as well as building density options. Results indicate green infrastructure could play a significant role in mitigating the urban overheating expected under a warming climate in the GCV Region. A green cover increase of approximately 20% over the present level could eliminate a third to a half of the expected extra urban heat island effect in 2050. This level of increase in green cover could also lead to local reductions in surface temperature by up to 2 degrees C. Over half of the street users would consider a 20% increase in green cover in the city centre to be thermally acceptable, even under a warm 2050 scenario. The process adopted here could be used to estimate the overheating problem as well as the effectiveness green infrastructure strategies to overcome them. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

      "Background Bicycling is healthy but needs to be safer for more to bike. Police crash templates are designed for reporting crashes between motor vehicles, but not between vehicles/bicycles. If written/drawn bicycle-crash-scene details exist, these are not entered into spreadsheets. Objective To assess which bicycle-crash-scene data might be added to spreadsheets for analysis. Methods Police crash templates from 50 states were analysed. Reports for 3350 motor vehicle/bicycle crashes (2011) were obtained for the New York City area and 300 cases selected (with drawings and on roads with sharrows, bike lanes, cycle tracks and no bike provisions). Crashes were redrawn and new bicycle-crash-scene details were coded and entered into the existing spreadsheet. The association between severity of injuries and bicycle-crash-scene codes was evaluated using multiple logistic regression. Results Police templates only consistently include pedal-cyclist and helmet. Bicycle-crash-scene coded variables for templates could include: 4 bicycle environments, 18 vehicle impact-points (opened-doors and mirrors), 4 bicycle impact-points, motor vehicle/bicycle crash patterns, in/out of the bicycle environment and bike/relevant motor vehicle categories. A test of including these variables suggested that, with bicyclists who had minor injuries as the control group, bicyclists on roads with bike lanes riding outside the lane had lower likelihood of severe injuries (OR, 0.40, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.98) compared with bicyclists riding on roads without bicycle facilities. Conclusions Police templates should include additional bicycle-crash-scene codes for entry into spreadsheets. Crash analysis, including with big data, could then be conducted on bicycle environments, motor vehicle potential impact points/doors/mirrors, bicycle potential impact points, motor vehicle characteristics, location and injury.\n",

      "This research identifies the commuting mode choice behaviour of 3537 adults living in different types of transit oriented development (TOD) in Brisbane by disentangling the effects of their \"evil twin\" transit adjacent developments (TADs), and by also controlling for residential self-selection, travel attitudes and preferences, and socio-demographic effects. A TwoStep cluster analysis was conducted to identify the natural groupings of respondents' living environment based on six built environment indicators. The analysis resulted in five types of neighbourhoods: urban TODs, activity centre TODs, potential TODs, TADs, and traditional suburbs. HABITAT survey data were used to derive the commute mode choice behaviour of people living in these neighbourhoods. In addition, statements reflecting both respondents' travel attitudes and living preferences were also collected as part of the survey. Factor analyses were conducted based on these statements and these derived factors were then used to control for residential self-selection. Four binary logistic regression models were estimated, one for each of the travel modes used (e.g. public transport, active transport, less sustainable transport such as the car/taxi, and other), to differentiate between the commuting behaviour of people living in the five types of neighbourhoods. The findings verify that urban TODs enhance the use of public transport and reduce car usage. No significant difference was found in the commuting behaviour between respondents living in traditional suburbs and TADs. The results confirm the hypothesis that TADs are the \"evil twin\" of TODs. The data indicates that TADs and the mode choices of residents in these neighbourhoods is a missed transport policy opportunity. Further policy efforts are required for a successive transition of TADs into TODs in order to realise the full benefits of these. TOD policy should also be integrated with context specific TOD design principles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "There is currently a lack of international harmonization on the insulation requirements for the buildings. Given that this parameter defines the maximum energy losses allowed through a thermal envelope, building energy consumptions can vary considerably between countries. Both the United States of America (US) and the European Union (EU) should address this problem by unifying the energy design criteria of their buildings. The EU requires that all new buildings constructed starting in 2020 must be nearly zero-energy buildings (nZEB), as defined in the Directive on Energy Efficiency in Buildings of 2010.To evaluate the extent of this lack of harmonization, in this paper are calculated the maximum energy losses through the thermal envelope of a typical dwelling when applying various international regulations (such as the US regulations and those established by Germany, France, England and Wales, and Spain). The results are compared with those obtained when applying the requirements of the Passivhaus standard (taken as a reference for nZEB in the EU). It will be verified that there are major differences in the energy losses allowed through building envelopes among these countries and among the different climate zones defined in each country.Moreover, the challenges set by these countries related to energy consumption and CO2 emissions are also reviewed. The disparity between the objectives proposed by these countries suggested a distinct tendency towards increasing current differences in their standards. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

      "With rapid growth of the vehicle population, urban passenger transport in China is largely responsible for increases in energy consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and also atmospheric pollutants (NOx, CO, HC, PM). In this paper, we first develop an urban passenger transport energy saving and emission reduction potential evaluation model using the \"Long Range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP)\" tool; and then take Tianjin city as an empirical case to evaluate the reduction potential of final energy consumption, GHG emissions and pollutants emissions of Tianjin's urban passenger transport sector between 2010 and 2040 under four scenarios, i.e. BAU (business as usual) scenario, PP (the 12th five-year plan policy) scenario, CP (comprehensive policy) scenario and HP (hybrid policy of PP and CP) scenario. The results show that due to the public transport promotion, energy consumption and CO2 emissions in 2040 can be reduced by 22% and 22.6% in the PP scenario, compared to BAU. The largest reductions in energy consumption, CO2 and atmospheric pollutants emissions can be achieved under CP scenario, in which vehicle population regulation is the most effective to be implemented. Emissions standard regulation is the most effective measure to reduce atmospheric pollutant emissions in all the scenarios and green energy promotion is especially effective to reduce NOx and PM.

      "Energy and water infrastructure in Abu Dhabi provides a strong example of the interconnection between energy and water, where the majority of its electricity and water demand is jointly produced from cogeneration plants. The total cost of fuel used for cogeneration plants are heavily depending on the efficiency level of end-use energy and water consumption. Buildings are the major electricity and water consumers with 84.6% and 92.2% respectively from the entire demand. The aim of this study is to analyze the energy and water consumption reduction by implementing Estidama pearl regulations and compare it with Business as Usual -the normal execution of things as they always do-for three sample buildings (villa, multistory residential and office building). For energy assessment, eQUEST software was used to examine the energy performance of the chosen buildings and to evaluate the energy saving potential after applying Estidama requirements. While for water assessment; Estidama and LEED calculation tools were used to do the same. The results of energy simulation and water analysis of the chosen buildings showed a potential of electricity reduction between 31% and 38% and a potential of water reduction between 22% and 36% depending on building type and other parameters. Also, a total monetary savings of 19 Billion AED can be achieved cumulatively over ten years period (2011-2020) after Estidama regulations have been applied. In addition, a reduction of 31.4 Million ton of CO(2)eq cumulatively can be achieved. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

However, the development of African continent is still very slow because of the limited policy interest and investment levels. The effective use of energy is crucial because of the continuous depletion of energy resources, especially for developing countries which are currently experiencing rapid economic and population growth. The aim of this article is to review the status and current trends in resource potential, energy consumption, and energy policies in the residential sector, both globally and in Cameroon. It was found that the world's energy needs are constantly growing and should exceed 50% of current levels by 2030. In Africa, most of the substantially renewable energy resources are under-exploited. We found that 83% of the rural population in Africa, 92% in Sub-Saharan Africa, and 70% in South Asia have no access to electricity. Especially in Cameroon, the energy consumption in the residential sector is about 70% of the total energy consumption, which is higher compared to the world level that is around 27%. Energy efficiency is very important in the context of sustainable development. Currently, traditional biomass is the main source of energy in Sub-Saharan Africa. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

      "For countries in the Arabian Peninsula, air conditioning (A/C) systems account for 65% of the energy consumption, all of which comes from fossil fuel. Given the preparation for the 2022 World Cup, which will be held in Qatar, the possibility of implementing ground source heat pump systems (GSHP) for A/C purposes is investigated. Due to its high thermal performance, GSHP is considered a viable solution for reducing the energy consumption of heating and A/C systems. However, for the GSHP system to gain popularity in cooling-dominated environments such as Qatar, financial and environmental benefits need to be demonstrated. These benefits strongly depend on local design practices and standards and on working conditions.The work presented in this paper demonstrates the energy savings by using GSHP systems in the residential buildings sector in cooling-dominated environments. To achieve this goal, a common type of residential house located in Doha, Qatar, was chosen as a case study. The cooling load of the case study and the driving energy of two different air conditioning systems were estimated. The two considered air conditioning systems are the conventional air source heat pump system (reference system) and the ground source heat pump system. Finally, economic analysis of the proposed system for construction practices in Qatar was carried out.The performed analyses show that the reduction in the prime energy demand and, consequently, the greenhouse gas emissions for the GSHP is 19% when compared to the conventional air source heat pump system. In addition, the analyses show that for the local conditions in Qatar the payback time of GSHP is 9 years. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Electric vehicles offer the potential to reduce oil consumption, air pollutants, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To take advantage of electric vehicles and improve its urban environment, Beijing, as one of China's most polluted cities, launched an electric vehicle promotion program that provided a generous subsidy for consumers who purchased battery electric vehicles (BEVs). In this study, we compare the levelized costs of a conventional vehicle (CV) versus a BEV using real data from the Beijing BEV subsidy program. Levelized cost for this study considers consumer driving patterns and vehicle age. For consumers with average driving profiles-i.e., an average driving distance of around 20 km per trip-the levelized cost of CVs decreases from 1.40 yuan/km for an 8-year vehicle lifetime to 1.04 yuan/km for a 15-year lifetime, while the levelized cost for BEVs decreases from 1.44 yuan/km for an 8-year vehicle lifetime to 1.01 yuan/km for a 15-year lifetime. BEVs are more cost competitive than CVs for consumers with medium and high driving profiles and a 12-year and 15-year lifetime. Under current conditions, the subsidy and tax incentives are necessary to make BEVs cost competitive. However, we project that, even if the subsidy is phased out in 2020, BEVs may become cost competitive with CVs because of the decrease in battery cost. Our study results suggest that the BEV subsidy should reflect changes in battery cost and gasoline prices to help continuing deployment of BEVs.\n",

      "European Union Member States, including Poland, undertaken efforts to fulfill Kyoto Protocol limitation and energy consumption and increased participation of renewable energy resources in the overall production. Building construction and exploitation is among the most energy consuming activities. Absorption of energy in buildings is limited by Directive 2002/91/EC, which regulates either existing buildings and directions of their improvement or new buildings to be designed.In Poland guidelines from directive have been defined by package of legal acts, which includes the Ordinance of the Ministry of Infrastructure, issued January 21, 2008 regarding methodology of calculate characteristic of energy in buildings. This ordinance suggest, that index of primary energy EP compared with reference index evaluate power consumption in buildings.Existing building (heated area A(f) = 136.56 m(2) and volume V = 520 m(3)) without basement, was considered for modernization decreasing energy consumption. As the starting point for the calculation was the coal-fired furnace controlled manually.Three different insulation materials groups, distinct type of additional installations (i.e: solar and ventilation system with heat recovery coefficient eta = 0.8) as well as three different energy sources and their combination were considered in simulations.The impact of modernization activities on the primary energy index (EP), final energy index (EK) and estimated annual cost of total consumption of energy building was considered.Based on simulations obtained that the change in isolation class building with isolation 1 to 2 causes an average rate of EP reduction for coal-fired furnace, gas furnace and condensing boiler of 20.5% and the biomass boiler by 11.1%. Changing the thickness of the isolation of the option 2 for Isolation 3 will be reducing respectively the rate of EP by 14.3% and 6.8%.The final energy demand of buildings was used to calculated estimated annual cost because only EK index take into account the size of usable energy. For example, in the case of the coal-fired furnace with the ventilation system and isolation 3 EP was 212.74 kWh / (m(2).year) with an annual estimated cost of energy consumption 2298 zl/year. For comparison, the installation equipped with a biomass boiler and isolation 1 EP was 114.34 kWh /(m(2).year) but the estimated annual cost of energy consumption was 5118 zl/year.Summarizing, only combination of biomass as a fuel and energy saving via proper insulation allows to achieve the reference index. Moreover reduction of EP index is not proper indicator of low annual cost of energy building consumption.\n",

However, as the final leg of any public transport journey is generally on foot, the provision of walking and road-crossing facilities has been accelerated to meet the diverse needs of pedestrians - ranging from small children to senior citizens and the disabled. This paper describes the physical measures that have been used to make pedestrian facilities in Singapore barrier-free, safe and secure. These include lighting of all facilities at night, sheltered footpaths, kerb-cut ramps when footpaths meet carriageways, raised zebra crossings, extensions of crossing times for senior citizens using concession fare-cards, special alarms at pedestrian signals for the visually handicapped, and ramps, escalators and lifts in addition to staircases for access to pedestrian bridges and underpasses. Whereas it is possible to make new pedestrian facilities barrier-free, retrofitting older facilities poses problems. It is hoped that the 2013 Land Transport Master Plan will spur a more concerted and accelerated effort towards achieving a truly accessible transport system for all by the year 2020.\n",

The intelligent glazed facade is capable of controlling the thermal, solar and mass transmittance by controlling shutters, blinds and openings. The facade and building services are designed and controlled holistically to optimize the indoor comfort (thermal, visual comfort and indoor air quality) and minimize the energy demand by heating, cooling, lighting and ventilation. The study is conducted numerically utilising a simplified hourly calculation method developed to calculate yearly energy and comfort performance of an office room equipped with an intelligent facade. The simplified method is verified by the Danish dynamic building simulation tool BSim and experimental test in a full scale test facility at Aalborg University (Cube). Results show that the annual primary energy demand of an office building with intelligent glazed facade can be reduced by approx. 60% compared with the same building with a static facade. Utilising the properties of an intelligent glazed facade, buildings can more easily comply with the future Danish Building Class 2020 as stipulated in the Danish Building Regulation 2010, BR10.

It is of great significance to probe the energy saving potential of the building sector and to explore the critical factors responsible for its energy saving practice, which may greatly benefit carbon emission reduction in the process of urbanization. In this paper, we develop a series of formulations to calculate both embodied and operating energy based on hybrid energy input-output model. Taking 2011-2050 as the study period, we combined the embodied and operating energy and designed six scenarios to comprehensively quantify the impacts of three factors: new building floor areas, energy efficiency standards and its implementation rate on the energy saving potential. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis was conducted to dissect the influence of the corresponding factors. The results show that improved standards and less new building floor areas will be the most effective ways to reduce energy consumption and that the best energy saving practice can save up to 20 billion tons of coal equivalent (tce) during the study period. The focus of policy reforms may be varied according to the times and regions. Energy saving technology development and more emphasis on key areas will reduce building energy consumption significantly in the short term, while household lifestyle changes, as well as improved building energy efficiency, should be given a higher priority in the long run.

      "Beyond energy efficiency, there are now urgent challenges around the supply of resources, materials, energy, food and water. After debating energy efficiency for the last decade, the focus has shifted to include further resources and material efficiency. In this context, urban farming has emerged as a valid urban design strategy, where food is produced and consumed locally within city boundaries, turning disused sites and underutilized public space into productive urban landscapes and community gardens. Furthermore, such agricultural activities allow for effective composting of organic waste, returning nutrients to the soil and improving biodiversity in the urban environment. Urban farming and resource recovery will help to feed the 9 billion by 2050 (predicted population growth, UN-Habitat forecast 2009). This paper reports on best practice of urban design principles in regard to materials flow, material recovery, adaptive re-use of entire building elements and components ('design for disassembly'; prefabrication of modular building components), and other relevant strategies to implement zero waste by avoiding waste creation, reducing wasteful consumption and changing behaviour in the design and construction sectors. The paper touches on two important issues in regard to the rapid depletion of the world's natural resources: the built environment and the education of architects and designers (both topics of further research). The construction and demolition (C&D) sector: Prefabricated multi-story buildings for inner-city living can set new benchmarks for minimizing construction wastage and for modular on-site assembly. Today, the C&D sector is one of the main producers of waste; it does not engage enough with waste minimization, waste avoidance and recycling. Education and research: It's still unclear how best to introduce a holistic understanding of these challenges and to better teach practical and affordable solutions to architects, urban designers, industrial designers, and so on. How must urban development and construction change and evolve to automatically embed sustainability in the way we design, build, operate, maintain and renew/recycle cities? One of the findings of this paper is that embedding zero-waste requires strong industry leadership, new policies and effective education curricula, as well as raising awareness (through research and education) and refocusing research agendas to bring about attitudinal change and the reduction of wasteful consumption.\n",

      "This paper presents some experience from using transport models in Swedish planning practice. First we outline three recent examples of planning settings in which transport models have been put to extensive use. For the Swedish 'national' transport plan for the period 2010-2021, which was recently finished, the national transport model SAMPERS was used to compute costs and benefits for many investment projects. The second example concerns the 'regional' plan for Stockholm, where a similar but less detailed model, LuTRANS, was used to investigate different transport and land use scenarios. The third example discusses a recent study on the feasibility of introducing congestion charges in Gothenburg, where both a fixed demand approach and SAMPERS were used. Furthermore, the paper tries to help identify what model development can do to help improve the production of decision support through modelling. We argue that effectiveness and efficiency are key. The first is characterized by making sure that the right things are done and that they are done right. Efficiency, which is less often discussed in the literature, is framed in terms of doing things on time and doing them only once. The managing organization around a national model system can play an important role in helping users avoid redundant work. It is also a good idea to resist the temptation to use up all improvements in computing power for additional model features. There are many worthwhile analyses that are never done because of time constraints.\n",

      "As representative for emerging vehicle market, China has one of the fastest growing rates of automobile ownership in the world. The huge and increasing vehicle stock has significantly contributed to the fast growing of China's energy demand and GHG emissions. It is an important issue to project China's vehicle ownership, which to a large extent determines China's oil demand and GHG emissions from road transportation sector in the future. In this study, we established a hybrid model with three sub models to simulate the growth patterns of China's private passenger vehicles, urban public transport vehicles and economic utility vehicles. By using this model, we projected that China's vehicle population would reach 184.8, 363.8 and 606.7 million by 2020, 2030 and 2050 respectively. The fast increase of urban private passenger vehicles is the main driving force for vehicle population growth. Population of urban private passenger vehicles would account for 70.1%, 81.1% and 86.1% of total vehicle population in 2020, 2030 and 2050 respectively. It was demonstrated by sensitivity analysis that vehicle population was quite sensitive to household income and vehicle price, implying an effective lever for regulating the growth of vehicle population.

      "Beijing, the capital of China, has experienced rapid motorization since 1990; a trend that is likely to continue. The growth in vehicles and the corresponding emissions create challenges to improving the urban air quality. In an effort to reduce the impact of vehicle emissions on urban air quality, Beijing has adopted a number of vehicle emission control strategies and policies since the mid 1990s. These are classified into seven categories: (1) emission control on new vehicles; (2) emission control on in-use vehicles; (3) fuel quality improvements; (4) alternative-fuel and advanced vehicles; (5) economic policies; (6) public transport; and (7) temporal traffic control measures. Many have proven to be successful, such as the Euro emission standards, unleaded gasoline and low sulfur fuel, temporal traffic control measures during the Beijing Olympic Games, etc. Some, however, have been failures, such as the gasoline-to-LPG taxi retrofit program. Thanks to the emission standards for new vehicles as well as other controls, the fleet-average emission rates of CO, HC, NO(X), and PM(10) by each major vehicle category are decreasing over time. For example, gasoline cars decreased fleet-average emission factors by 12.5% for CO, 10.0% for HC, 5.8% for NO(X), and 13.0% for PM(10) annually since 1995, and such a trend is likely to continue. Total emissions for Beijing's vehicle fleet increased from 1995 to 1998. However, they show a clear and steady decrease between 1999 and 2009. In 2009, total emissions of CO, HC, NO(X), and PM(10) were 845 000 t, 121 000 t, 84 000 t, and 3700 t, respectively; with reductions of 47%, 49%, 47%, and 42%, relative to 1998. Beijing has been considered a pioneer in controlling vehicle emissions within China, similar to the role of California to the U.S. The continued rapid growth of vehicles, however, is challenging Beijing's policy-makers.\n",

      "This research explored the possibility of achieving significant carbon reductions from personal land-based transport using London as a case study. A profile of carbon emissions from personal land-based transport modes was derived using Great Britain National Travel Survey (NTS) data and a range of carbon emissions factors. A carbon calculator provided carbon consumption per trip. NTS survey data were grossed up to national level using Census of Population data. A baseline of carbon emissions, based on equal per capita consumption, was projected to 2050 using estimates of future population. Four future scenarios were developed and tested using this data. These were: (a) based on the London Mayor's Climate Change Action Plan; (b) a technology focussed scenario; (c) a personal carbon trading scenario; and (d) a radical walking and cycling scenario. Results suggest that the latter two scenarios have the potential to achieve emissions reductions in excess of 80%, while scenarios (a) and (b) are somewhat weaker, though still achieve substantial reductions in carbon emissions compared to business as usual.\n",

      "A model for the calculation of solar heat gain through glazed surfaces, to be used in the simplified calculation of thermal energy requirements in air-conditioned buildings, is proposed. The model uses the effective absorption coefficient of the indoor environment to take into account that the entering energy is in part absorbed by the surfaces of the cavity and in part is dispersed outwards, through the same glazed surfaces. The effective absorption coefficient is calculated by means of a correlation, and is made to depend on the average absorption coefficient of the internal opaque surfaces of the environment, on the glazed fraction and on the transmission coefficient of diffuse radiation of the glazed system. This coefficient permits a more accurate evaluation of solar heat gain through glazed surfaces, obtained adding: the direct optical contribution, produced by solar radiation absorbed by the indoor environment, the direct secondary contribution, produced by external solar radiation absorbed by the glazed surfaces, the indirect secondary contribution, produced by the absorption of reflected radiation exiting the indoor environment. The model, validated by means of comparisons with the TRNSYS 16 code, was used for the verification of the monthly solar heat gain calculation procedure of EN ISO 13790:2008. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

      "The U.S. Department of Energy has launched the commercial building initiative (CBI) in pursuit of its research goal of achieving zero-net-energy commercial buildings (ZNEB), i.e., ones that produce as much energy as they use. Its objective is to make these buildings marketable by 2025 such that they minimize their energy use through cutting-edge, energy-efficiency technologies and meet their remaining energy needs through on-site renewable energy generation. This paper examines how such buildings may be implemented within the context of a cost-or CO(2)-minimizing microgrid that is able to adopt and operate various technologies: photovoltaic (PV) modules and other on-site generation, heat exchangers, solar thermal collectors, absorption chillers, and passive/demand-response technologies. A mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that has a multi-criteria objective function is used. The objective is minimization of a weighted average of the building's annual energy costs and CO(2) emissions. The MILP's constraints ensure energy balance and capacity limits. In addition, constraining the building's energy consumed to equal its energy exports enables us to explore how energy sales and demand-response measures may enable compliance with the ZNEB objective. Using a commercial test site in northern California with existing tariff rates and technology data, we find that a ZNEB requires ample PV capacity installed to ensure electricity sales during the day. This is complemented by investment in energy-efficient combined heat and power (CHP) equipment, while occasional demand response saves energy consumption. A large amount of storage is also adopted, which may be impractical. Nevertheless, it shows the nature of the solutions and costs necessary to achieve a ZNEB. Additionally, the ZNEB approach does not necessary lead to zero-carbon (ZC) buildings as is frequently argued. We also show a multi-objective frontier for the CA example, which allows us to estimate the needed technologies and costs for achieving a ZC building or microgrid.

      "The building sector is regarded as having one of the highest benefit-cost ratios from greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction strategies. However, because of uncertainties around household behaviour patterns, it is very difficult to assess and compare the GHG reduction impacts of different intervention schemes for whole housing stock. Intervention schemes include policy instruments such as incentives or rebates for energy efficient appliances or renewable energy, and regulatory building code requirements for energy efficiency. This paper presents a decision support tool based on mathematical diffusion that evaluates the adoption levels of different schemes or pathways towards reducing GHG emissions in housing stock. It is an extension of the Bass diffusion model that accommodates financial and non-financial benefits, ceilings of adoption and interactions between intervention options. The model capability was tested using a case study of seven suburbs in Brisbane, Australia, comprising of 25,000 houses and units. Estimates of GHG emission reductions to 2019 of a household rebate scheme for solar panels and a rebate scheme for solar hot water compared to a base case of no rebates were presented and analysed. Modelling also allowed identification of important characteristics of adoption trends that could assist policy makers and industry to substantially improve the design of effective intervention options.

      "Alternative uses of waste for energy production become increasingly interesting when considered from two perspectives, that of waste management and the energy system perspective. This paper presents the results of an enquiry into the use of waste in a future energy system. The analysis was performed using the energy system analysis model, Balmorel. The study is focused on Germany and the Nordic countries and demonstrates the optimization of both investments and production within the energy systems. The results present cost optimization excluding taxation concerning the use of waste for energy production in Denmark in a 2025 scenario with 48% renewable energy. Investments in a range of waste conversion technologies are facilitated, including waste incineration, co-combustion with coal, anaerobic digestion, and gasification. The most economically feasible solutions are found to be incineration of mixed waste, anaerobic digestion of organic waste, and gasification of part of the potential RDF (refuse derived fuel) for CHP (combined heat and power) production, while the remaining part is co-combusted with coal. Co-combustion mainly takes place in new coal-fired power plants, allowing investments to increase in comparison with a situation where only investments in waste incineration are allowed.

      "A questionnaire survey consisting of 2400 householders was performed on Abadan residents to evaluate their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards solid waste (SW) reduction, source separation and recycling, collection and willingness to pay (WTP) for SW services. The study has also covered the relationship between demographic variables and KAP towards SW management. The data analyzed suggests that the studied community had a very positive attitude to take part in SW source separation and recycling plans. However, the respondents not only showed low intimate knowledge of different steps of SW management, but were also weak to take practices about these steps. The KAP of SW source separation and recycling was influenced by demographic factors of age, education level, gender and occupation. It was further found that education level and occupation were two significant factors affecting residents' WTP (chi(2) = 24.083, p-value <0.0001). In conclusion our study found that providing public with MSW infrastructures and improving citizens' awareness about SW source separation and recycling to promote SW recycling programs hold great promise for developing effective public campaigns and behavior-changing interventions. This has important implications in that the usual KAP of public proved inadequate in the case of SW source separation and recycling. The implementation of needs-based training programmes considering females as one of the main audience groups and determination of municipality needs are thereby highly advocated.

      "Increasing urbanisation around the world has raised the passenger demand for public transport. Many public transport technologies are available to meet this demand. This paper develops a spreadsheet cost model that simulates public transport modes operated on a 12-km route and incorporates a new public transport mode, the straddle bus. Previous research has assumed that demand is exogenous (externally fixed). This work investigates the impact of endogenous demand, which varies with service level characteristics. Elasticities for passenger waiting time and in-vehicle time are used to assess actual passenger reactions to the attractiveness for different public transport technologies at different levels of demand. The result of this work shows the lowest average social and operator cost public transport technologies for different ranges of demand. Based on the default values used in the spreadsheet model, smaller size vehicles (e.g. personal rapid transit and minibus) dominate the low passenger demand range due to their short waiting times. Single-decker and double-decker buses appear to be the best option for a demand of around 3000-60 000 passengers per day (ppd), followed by the straddle bus (from around 60 000 to 100 000 ppd). The great capacity but high capital costs of underground make it the most cost-effective technology when other technologies are experiencing high congestion, with demand levels higher than 100 000 ppd.\n",

      "We present a method for quantifying the energy efficiency gap ex ante. To do this, we define the energy efficiency gap as being the difference between the ex ante market and techno-economic energy savings potentials. The estimation of market potential is based on top-down (econometric) modelling of energy demand using data from the period 1970-2005. The techno-economic estimates are made using a bottom-up building stock model (ECCABS) to assess the effects and cost-efficiency of various energy efficiency measures. Common to these two modelling approaches are two scenarios of energy prices, which differ only with respect to the carbon tax component. We implement the method for the case of useful energy demand for space and water heating in the Swedish residential sector up to 2030. In comparison to the level of energy use in 2005 (74 TWh), the top-down model predicts for 2030 reductions in demand for the two price scenarios of 17 and 21 TWh respectively. The bottom-up model predicts corresponding reductions in demand of 25 and 31 TWh respectively. Thus, there is an energy efficiency gap calculated of at least 8 TWh in 2030. An implicit discount rate of 10 % would render the results from the bottom-up modelling identical to those from the top-down modelling. The presence of the energy efficiency gap indicates that there is a need for enhanced policies in order to make future reductions in energy demand reach the levels predicted by the bottom-up modelling.\n",

      "Heat pumps play a central role in decarbonising the UK's buildings sector as part of the Committee on Climate Change's (CCC) updated abatement scenario for meeting the UK's fourth carbon budget. However, the UK has one of the least developed heat pump markets in Europe and renewable heat output from heat pumps will need to increase by a factor of 50 over the next 15 years to be in line with the scenario. Therefore, this paper explores what lessons the UK might learn from Finland to achieve this aim considering that its current level of heat pump penetration is comparable with that outlined in the CCC scenario for 2030. Despite the two countries' characteristic differences we argue they share sufficient similarities for the UK to usefully draw some policy-based lessons from Finland including: stimulating new-build construction and renovation of existing stock; incorporating renewable heat solutions in building energy performance standards; and bringing the cost of heat pumps in-line with gas fired heating via a combination of subsidies, taxes and energy RD&D. Finally, preliminary efforts to grow the heat pump market could usefully focus on properties unconnected to the gas-grid, considering these are typically heated by relatively expensive oil or electric heating technologies.

      "Greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting for individual cities in large metropolitan areas is confounded by spatial scale and boundary effects that impact the allocation of transportation fuels used for surface transport and airline travel. This paper expands on a demand-based methodology to spatially allocate transportation fuel use (surface and airline) among colocated cities in the United States that are part of a larger metropolitan area commutershed on the basis of demand for surface vehicle miles traveled (VMT) exerted by individual cities. By using travel demand models for metropolitan planning organizations, the demand method was first applied as part of the city of Denver's GHG inventory in 2005 to develop a material flow analysis (MFA) of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel consumption at the city scale. This paper reports on the application of the same method to six major metropolitan regions across the United States and a detailed analysis of all 27 cities within the larger Denver metro region. The analysis of six metropolitan areas in the United States demonstrated (1) the demand method produces VMT estimates allocated to cities across the commutershed that are similar (within 6%) to the boundary-limited polygon approach (linear correlation coefficient R(2) = 0.82; slope m = 0.98); (2) airline travel allocation by vehicular trip count ratios to the regional airport from colocated cities produces results similar to regional airline travel allocation by population ratios (linear correlation coefficient R(2) = 0.96; slope m = 0.99); and (3) the method is replicable with necessary data available from all cities in this study through their corresponding metropolitan planning organizations. In addition, the demand-VMT allocation method is found to be more responsive to future simulated mass transit growth. Further, the method is sensitive to local travel demand features of the individual cities, of which employment intensity was found to have the largest impact on per capita VMT allocated to a city. Within the Denver commutershed, daily VMT per capita estimates ranged from 13-129 km/capita/day (8-80 mi/capita/day) among the 27 communities, with a strong positive correlation with employment intensity (employment/capita; R(2) = 0.97) and employment density (employment/kilometer; R(2) = 0.59).

      "The concept of passive and low energy houses became fashionable in the last years and the European Parliament also initiated a proposal to build only near zero energy houses from 2018. The regulations already in force aim at low energy consumption (most likely influenced by the wide spreading of the \"Passivhaus\" concept in Europe) and by 2018 harmonized regulations and standards will require the near zero energy building. According to the concept of the Energy Performance of Building Directive, this means strict limitation of the integrated specific energy consumption (measured in primary energy), which includes a variety of operational energy consumption. Some components of this consumption depend exclusively on the users' behaviors while others depend on the building and the user's interactions. The concept of near zero operational energy means that the energy needed for the building is so low that it can be - fully or mostly - covered with renewables. In other terms, it means that, during most part of the winter the building will be in a free running regime thus without using mechanical or active heating systems. On one hand, decision makers and politicians may declare their wish or aim, while on the other hand it is questionable whether the expectation of the inhabitants and the requirements of the regulations coincide. In the followings, after a brief overview of the regulations, the assumed indoor thermal comfort conditions in free running regime and using limited back-up heating will be analyzed.\n",

The objective of this study was under these premises, with emphasis on the participation of society to manage kitchen wastes and garden residues through composting in a residential area of Zapopan, Jalisco, in August, 2007. A program of collection, quantification, classification and evaluation of the neighbors' response to the call to separate the kitchen waste was implemented. For composting the residues were deposited in two wooden bins in alternating layers with garden waste up to place 3000 kg of kitchen waste and 1595 kg of garden waste per bin. The composting period was 105 d, in which an average of 4 kg garbage d(-1) house(-1) was generated. Each household generated an average of 1.92 kg(-1) of kitchen waste. According to the 21 fractions of waste classification, it was found that 47.4 % were kitchen waste, 10.7 % paper, 7.4 % garden waste and 0.4 % aluminum cans and paper. In addition, 61 % of household waste can be handled by composting, 24.3 % by recycling, 12.4 % by composting when consumption patterns of the population change by using new technologies to manufacture compostable materials and only 2.3 % can be handled in sanitary landfills. At the end of composting the kitchen and garden wastes became a product with texture and smell similar to a gardening land; the loss of volume and dry matter was 44 and 44.7 %. The compost was characterized by: pH 8.26, conductivity 5.55 dS m(-1), total N 1.5 %, Na 370.54 mg kg(-1), 35.38 mg kg(-1), Be 0.56 mg kg(-1), Al 7927 mg kg(-1), Ba 44 mg kg(-1), Cd 0.49 mg kg(-1), Ca 5.44%, Cr 6.33 mg kg(-1), Pb 8.67 mg kg(-1), Co 1.42 mg kg(-1), 4379.74 mg kg(-1) Mg 0.32%, Mn 767.07 mg kg(-1), Mo 13.75 mg kg(-1), Ni 3.16 mg kg(-1), P 0.24 %, K 1.2 %, Ag<0.29 mg kg(-1), Zn 165.28 mg kg(-1), Sb 18.87 mg kg(-1), Ti 118.99 mg kg(-1) and V 10.32 mg kg(-1).

According to the analysis 2369 kg of kitchen waste and 1185 kg of garden residues should be subjected to composting per day. For 120 d of composting it is required a minimum area of 2257 m(2), where 10 windows (31 m long, 3 m wide and 2 m high) would be installed to have a compost production of 2246 kg d(-1) to reach the stationary phase.\n",

      "Land-use and transport systems are an important determinant of carbon dioxide emissions from urban regions. It is often asserted that urban compaction is the spatial policy best able to constrain travel and emissions, but evidence supporting this assertion is limited, particularly with respect to the combined emission from transport and land use. Here, using land-use - transport interaction models, a residential dwelling type model, and transport and emission models, we forecast and assess carbon dioxide emissions from transport, dwellings, and commercial space to 2031 for a range of spatial strategies realistically investigated for three English regions of decreasing size (the Wider South East region, Tyne and Wear, and Cambridge). Our results reveal that compaction can reduce emission relative to other spatial scenarios but that the differences are small, about 5% between extremes, an order of magnitude less than emission growth observed over the trend period. Form has more influence for settlements where the pattern and proximity of employment, housing, and services can make cycling, walking, and public transport provision more feasible. We conclude that pricing and technology measures offer better prospects for combating the growth in carbon emissions of urban regions, but that the type of urban form delivered is likely to be a significant determinant in the type of clean energy technology that can be implemented.\n",

      "The Dutch government intends to sharpen the current energy performance standard of the national building regulations for new buildings (Energy Performance Coefficient) step by step to an energy-neutral level by 2020. In their climate policies, municipalities are preparing to meet this level for new buildings-some of them even earlier. Nevertheless, possibilities to impose energy performance levels, higher than formulated at national level, are limited for municipalities. This paper investigates, how and through which policy instruments Dutch municipal authorities can promote energy-neutral new housing developments. This research suggests the following municipal climate governance approach and instruments: (1) an integrated design strategy for sustainable energy systems throughout the city: in both urban areas and buildings; (2) market-party-selection in tendering procedures based on sustainability criteria, including the energy performance of dwellings; (3) encouragement of community engagement for the deployment of renewable energy sources; (4) (inter) regional cooperation among cities in similar climatic zones on the development of both more uniform calculation methods for zero-energy buildings, and of a more uniform methodology for cities to monitor progress towards the self-set targets. However, stable and long-term-oriented European and national financial support for municipalities seems to be needed for municipal climate governance to become successful.\n",

The most important fractions of recycled dry solid waste in Mashhad included paper and board (51.33%), stale bread (14.59%), glass (9.73%), ferrous metals (9.73%), plastic (9.73%), polyethylene terephthalate (2.62%) and non-ferrous metals (0.97%). It can be concluded that unfortunately the potential of dry solid waste recycling in Mashhad has not been considered properly and there is a great effort to be made in order to achieve the desired conditions of recycling.\n",

      "This article focuses on the results obtained by the enforcement of a original greenhouse gas emissions policy, issued in recent years in several municipalities in Northern Italy. The Municipality of Reggio Emilia was one of the firsts in Italy to develop and adopt a voluntary building energy-consumption certification method called Ecoabita, aiming to promote energy efficiency in buildings over its jurisdiction. Several reasons make this project innovative: first, the certification method has been processed through and verified by a quality international agency, secondly the procedure is assisting financial-incentive policies both on mandatory (European Directive 2002/91/CE) and voluntary basis (Municipality Protocol Ecoabita), finally it allows to obtain eligible credits for avoided emissions that can be negotiated on the CO(2) exchange market. With specific reference to Reggio Emilia case, acknowledged the amount of actions, that are normally scheduled in the municipality throughout a year, it has been evaluated the benefit, in terms of environmental improvement, descended from the protocol, also projecting their trend in future years up to 2020 as well, demonstrating the scheduled interventions are fundamental in sought of the achievement of the Kyoto and Copenhagen commitments. The entire procedure has been developed in accordance to the parameters given by UNFCCC for these kinds of analyses and has been recently confirmed to be one of the most accurate international accounting procedure by a survey developed by the scientific committee of the European Project LIFE-LAKS.

      "In recent times, climate change has emerged as one of the most challenging political and scientific issues of our times. The Brundtland Report and Rio Conference highlighted the significance of local actions as means of securing global sustainable development. This is further emphasized by the projection that 70% of the world's population will live in cities by 2050 (UN-HABITAT, 2008). With ever increasing trends in urban consumption and production practices, a call for action against climate change is often seen as a way to foster sustainable development. Considerable attention is now being paid to determine what urban sustainability would include.OECD (n.d.) says that \"cities are centres of innovation and can advance clean energy systems, sustainable transportation, waste management and spatial development strategies to reduce greenhouse gases. With access to up to date climate science, impacts and vulnerability assessment, local authorities can also work with local stakeholders to design and implement effective adaptation strategies.\"In present times however, cities try to respond to climate change through programs and initiatives in the absence of any integrated, continuous and long-term strategy. To change this situation, we propose that programs and initiatives must be financially beneficial to all stakeholders. Collaboration between local government, local businesses and residents is a necessary condition. Success depends on creating a balanced win-win situation for all stakeholders.This paper looks at how political, business and individual responses can be integrated in a conceptual model that positively addresses climate change in a municipal context and is also fiscally sustainable.

      "As of October 1, 2008, the Department of the Navy established the requirement that all new buildings constructed for the United States Navy (USN) and United States Marine Corps (USMC) obtain a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver certification by the United States Green Building Council (USGBC). The goal of this requirement is to comply with Executive Order (EO) 13423, which mandates that all government departments reduce energy consumption by 30% by 2015. This research analyzes whether the 11 LEED-certified USN buildings have achieved the expected energy consumption savings. Energy data from LEED-certified buildings was compared with other USN and USMC non-certified buildings of comparable size, usage, and location. Statistical analysis shows that 9 of 11 LEED buildings did not achieve a 30% savings in electricity consumption, while seven of nine met the water consumption savings requirements set in place by EO 13423. Furthermore, this research concludes that the majority of the USN LEED-certified buildings actually showed more electricity consumption than the national averages as published by the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey.

      "The academic debate on sustainable city is like a large arena, where heterogeneous approaches and contributions, coming from different disciplines, flow into without converging on a common vision. The growing awareness that an increasing percentage of the world's population now lives in urban areas makes the organization of this space a crucial issue for global sustainable development. In order to acquire this challenge, urban studies need to overcome conceptual oppositions, seeking new integrated responses to implement the principle of sustainability at urban scale. This effort requires a new managerial approach of science and policy, which can be based on a transdisciplinary vision to knowledge production. The paper is divided into four different sections. The first and second sections review the theoretical literature on urban sustainability and explore the conceptual relations between knowledge and knowledge production in urban governance processes. The third section presents a comparative empirical analysis based on a survey of 2213 questionnaires carried out in four different urban contexts. The fourth and last section outlines the conclusion, suggesting a new approach to manage knowledge in urban governance, in a trans-disciplinary perspective. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

      "The Taipei Bus Station is the main transportation hub for over 50 bus routes to eastern, central, and southern Taiwan. Daily traffic volume at this station is about 2500 vehicles, serving over 45,000 passengers daily. The station is a massive 24-story building housing a bus terminal, a business hotel, a shopping mall, several cinemas, offices, private residential suites, and over 900 parking spaces. However, air quality inside this bus terminal is a concern as over 2500 buses are scheduled to run daily. This study investigates the PM10, PM2.5, UFP and CO2 levels inside and outside the bus terminal. All measurements were taken between February and April 2010. Measurement results show that coarse PM inside the bus terminal was resuspended by the movement of large numbers of passengers. The fine and ultrafine PM in the station concourse were from outside vehicles. Moreover, fine and ultrafine PM at waiting areas were exhausted directly from buses in the building. The CO2 levels at waiting areas were likely elevated by bus exhaust and passengers exhaling. The PM10, PM2.5 and CO2 levels at the bus terminal were lower than Taiwan's EPA suggested standards for indoor air quality. However, UFP levels at the bus terminal were significantly higher than those in the urban background by about 10 times. Therefore, the effects of UFPs on the health of passengers and workers must be addressed at this bus terminal since the levels of UFPs are higher than > 1.0 x 10(5) particles cm(-3).

      "German regulations for the thermal renovation of existing homes demand high thermal standards, which the government claims are technically and economically feasible. This paper examines existing data on 3400 German homes; their calculated energy performance ratings (EPR) are then plotted against the actual measured consumption. The results indicate that occupants consume, on average, 30% less heating energy than the calculated rating. This phenomenon is identified as the 'prebound' effect and increases with the calculated rating. The opposite phenomenon, the rebound effect, tends to occur for low-energy dwellings, where occupants consume more than the rating. A similar phenomenon has been recognized in recent Dutch, Belgian, French and UK studies, suggesting policy implications in two directions. Firstly, using a dwelling's energy rating to predict fuel and CO2 savings through retrofits tends to overestimate savings, underestimate the payback time and possibly discourage cost-effective, incremental improvements. Secondly, the potential fuel and CO2 savings through non-technical measures such as occupant behaviour may well be far larger than is generally assumed in policies so policy-makers need a better understanding of what drives or inhibits occupants' decisions.\n",

      "The Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) has experienced a rapid growth. Up to 2010, 2763 projects have been registered, standing for about 433 million ton CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq.) of annual carbon credits. However, the performances of CDM host countries are remarkably unbalanced. Previous literature suggested that economic and investment conditions, energy intensity, energy structure, the share of annual carbon credits from high global warming potential (GWP) green house gas (GHG), capacity and institutional buildings of domestic CDM governance can play important roles in promoting CDM. This quantitative analysis shows that domestic economic and investment conditions are the most decisive factors determining the performance of the CDM host countries. Additionally, the influence of carbon intensity of energy consumption is relatively modest, and energy intensity of GDP as well as the share of annual carbon credits from high GWP GHG is less significant. Moreover, several leading CDM countries are not as successful as they seem to be, when the influences of their vast territories, distinguished economic and investment conditions are excluded. Therefore, to simply transplant the CDM governances of these countries can hardly guarantee that other countries will boost their carbon credit outputs.\n",
