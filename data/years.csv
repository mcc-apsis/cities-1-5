0,"We carried out a life cycle assessment to model the potential for alternative household vegetable gardens (AHHVGs) to mitigate global climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) for Santa Barbara County, California, USA. Our model included changes in GHGE due to the effect of creating an AHHVG for five components: reduction of lawn area due to replacement by the AHHVG; reduction of vegetables purchased from the conventional agrifood system due to replacement by vegetables produced in the AHHVG; reduction in amount of greywater exported to treatment facilities due to diversion to irrigate the AHHVG; reduction in amount of household organic waste exported to treatment facilities due to diversion to composting at the household level for application to the AHHVG; and composting organic household waste for use in the AHHVG. We found that AHHVGs could reduce emissions by over 2 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) vegetable, but that results were sensitive to the range of values for the key variables of yield and alternative methods for processing household organic waste. In our baseline scenario (50% of singlefamily households with an 18.7 m(2) AHHVG, providing 50% of their vegetable consumption), AHHVGs contributed 3.3% of the GHGE reduction goals of unincorporated Santa Barbara County for 2020, 0.5% of the goals for the City of Santa Barbara for 2050, and by extrapolation, 7.8% of the goals for California for 2020. Our results could provide an incentive for governments to include support of AHHVG as part of climate mitigation strategies, and for households to grow vegetables in AHHVGs to address climate change.

3,"To identify and evaluate sustainable strategies of taxi fleet in Beijing in terms of economic, policy, and environmental implications, a hybrid approach was developed through incorporating multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods within a general life-cycle analysis (LCA) framework. The approach can (a) help comprehensive evaluate environmental impacts of multiple types of vehicles, (b) facilitate analysis of environmental, economic and policy features of such vehicles, and (c) identify desirable taxi fleet development strategies for the city. The developed approach represented an improvement of the decision-making capability for taxi implementation based on multiple available technologies and their performance that can be specifically tailored to Beijing. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach could comprehensively reflect multiple implications of strategies for the taxi fleet in Beijing to reduce air pollution in the city. The results also indicated that the electric vehicle powered with the year 2020 electricity projections would be the ideal solution, outranking the other alternatives. The conventional vehicle ranked the lowest among the alternatives. The plug-in hybrid vehicle powered by 2020 electricity projects ranked the third, followed by the plug-in hybrid vehicle ranking the fourth, and the hybrid vehicle ranking the fifth.

4,"In many nations industrial scale AD of non-agricultural waste materials (such as MSW) has not yet reached its full potential, often constrained by the lack of secure, inexpensive, high quality AD feedstocks, and markets for the resulting digestate material. We tested the output material of a high throughput novel industrial process to define its potential as an AD feedstock (based on quality and consistency). This process, designed to circumvent the constraints of source segregation while still generating segregated waste streams, resulted in the production of a temporally homogenous fibrous material with: an average moisture content of 44.2 (+/- 2.33)%; C:N ratio of 32.9:1 (+/- 3.46:1), C:P ratio of similar to 228:1 and gross calorific value of 17.4 (+/- 0.29) MJ/kg((Dm)). This material provided a CH4 yield of between 201 and 297 m(3) CH4/tonneo((DM)) (271-401 m(3) CH4/tonne((Vs))) comparable to commonly used AD feedstocks. Material contaminant levels were temporally consistent (P > 0.05), (average values being Cd 0.63 (+/- 0.19), Cu 56.3 (+/- 7.45), Cr-tot 51.4 (+/- 4.41), Hg < 0.3, Ni 28.9 (+/- 5.17), Pb 79.2 (+/- 23.71), Zn 202 (+/- 44.5), total polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) 2.2 (+/- 0.3), and total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) (<0.2) mg/kg((DM))). Calculated digestate contaminant levels were below the median contaminant threshold limits for anaerobic digestates of all countries within the European Union i.e. of Cd 3.35, Cu 535, Cr-tot 535, Hg 8.15, Ni 185, Pb 397.5, Zn 2100 mg/kg((DM)). We suggest that novel high throughput processes that produce high quality AD feedstocks, may have a place in further diversion of waste from landfill.

5,"China has been the world's largest cement producer and the cement production has led to increased energy consumption and CO2 emissions, which greatly affect the country's social and economic development. In this paper, an integrated assessment framework was developed by combining the Stock-based model and the Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System model of China (China TIMES), and it was used in China's cement sector to simulate the trends of energy consumption and CO2 emissions during 2010-2050, under a reference scenario and three carbon tax scenarios. The modeling results show that: (1) the cement production in China will increase from 1.8 billion tons in 2010, to a peak of 2.5 billion tons in around 2017, and then gradually decrease to 1.5 billion tons in 2050; (2) Through the adoption of three alternative abatement measures (i.e., switching the fuel types, implementing the energy-efficient measures and CCS), China's cement sector could potentially achieve a great reduction in CO2 emissions; (3) In the near future, the cement sector's decarbonisation will mainly rely on energy efficiency improvement; while the use of alternative fuel use and CCS will be of great significance from a long-term perspective. Additionally, based on the modeling results, we build the energy-saving and emission-reduction technologies roadmap for China's cement sector. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

6,"In November 2015, China government announced that the national carbon emissions trading market is expected to start in 2017. Carbon emission trading system is a raising concern from day to day, in which the allocation of carbon quotas has the closest relationship with trading units directly determining the cost of carbon trading. Initial allowance allocation is fundamental, but it proposes difficulty in terms of the trading mechanism design. This paper is based on the total control principle of national layout, in which the government sets up the cap of emissions in the carbon emissions trading system and focuses on the historical emission allocation concept from the perspective of fairness and history responsibility meaning that the allocation of quota in the future is based on the historical emissions. Firstly, we carry out comparative analysis based on the economy development and the emissions of 31 provinces and cities in China and select the sign-post province, Hebei. Secondly, we take the sign-post province as benchmarking and compare the benchmarking with the other provinces on the economy to set three quota situations of different initial years. Finally, we conduct quota calculation of residual carbon dioxide of various provinces by the end of 2020 and provide the specific quota calculation plans under different situations. The result of quota indicates: Most provinces still have more or less surplus to reallocate by the end of 2020; some provinces and cities have developing economy at expense of large emission and old industrial area with high energy consumption and high coal demand are in the shortage of future emission space; for the developed areas, the earlier emissions accounting is not good for their owning surplus; the earlier the years we select as the starting to account the quota, the greater the reductions space we will have. Meanwhile, we carry out testing of the feasibility of self-providing quota plans. These results may provide corresponding policy advice for China.",WOS:000391611900028,2020,"{emiss, carbon, ghg}",383
7,"BACKGROUND: By 2050, nearly 70% of the global population is projected to live in urban areas. Because the environments we inhabit affect our health, urban and transport designs that promote healthy living are needed. OBJECTIVE: We estimated the number of premature deaths preventable under compliance with international exposure recommendations for physical activity (PA), air pollution, noise, heat, and access to green spaces. METHODS: We developed and applied the Urban and TranspOrt Planning Health Impact Assessment (UTOPHIA) tool to Barcelona, Spain. Exposure estimates and mortality data were available for 1,357,361 residents. We compared recommended with current exposure levels. We quantified the associations between exposures and mortality and calculated population attributable fractions to estimate the number of premature deaths preventable. We also modeled life-expectancy and economic impacts. RESULTS: We estimated that annually, nearly 20% of mortality could be prevented if international recommendations for performance of PA; exposure to air pollution, noise, and heat; and access to green space were followed. Estimations showed that the greatest portion of preventable deaths was attributable to increases in PA, followed by reductions of exposure to air pollution, traffic noise, and heat. Access to green spaces had smaller effects on mortality. Compliance was estimated to increase the average life expectancy by 360 (95% CI: 219, 493) days and result in economic savings of 9.3 (95% CI: 4.9, 13.2) billion EUR/ year. CONCLUSIONS: PA factors and environmental exposures can be modified by changes in urban and transport planning. We emphasize the need for a) the reduction of motorized traffic through the promotion of active and public transport and b) the provision of green infrastructure, both of which are suggested to provide opportunities for PA and for mitigation of air pollution, noise, and heat.",WOS:000392195000012,2050,"{air, pollut, qualiti}",229
8,"Indonesia has a regulation UU No. 18/2008 which changes the paradigm from waste dumping to recycling. The purpose of this study is to understand the achievement and obstacles of community-based waste recycling through the solid waste bank (SW bank) program and its potency to improve the local MSW management in Indonesia. SW bank program is a unique organization developed among Indonesian communities to facilitate citizen participation in solid waste recycling. The banking system is adopted, and the community deposits the wastes instead of money. Case study was done for Padang city. The existing condition in 2013 suggests that the amount of solid waste recycled by SW bank activity was only 0.05 % of the total MSW generation. This condition results in 35 % waste without proper treatment. To improve the existing condition, development scenario is planned for 15 years. This development scenario may result in the increase of recycling amount of SW bank activity to 6 % of the total MSW generation in 2028. SWOT analysis suggests that some strategies such as creating a local regulation may be adopted to utilize the potency of SW bank for local MSW management improvement.",WOS:000392385300021,2028,"{wast, manag, solid}",517
9,"Energy conservation and CO2 abatement is currently an important development strategy for China. It is significant to analyze how to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions in China's energy-intensive machinery industry. We not only employ a cointegration method and scenario analysis to predict the future energy demand and CO2 emissions in China's machinery industry, but we also use the Monte Carlo simulation to test the validity of the predictions. The results show that energy demand in the industry will respectively reach 678.759 Mtce (million ton coal equivalent) in 2020 and 865.494 Mtce in 2025 under the baseline scenario. Compared with the baseline scenario, the energy savings in 2020 will respectively be 63.654 Mtce and 120.787 Mtce in the medium and advanced scenarios. Furthermore, we forecast the corresponding CO2 emissions as well as the reduction potential respectively in 2020 and 2025. In order to achieve energy conservation and emissions reduction, the government should increase energy price, levy environmental taxes based on the emissions level of machinery enterprises, promote mergers and acquisitions of enterprises, and expand the scale of enterprises.

12,"This study adapts a climate change mitigation model to assess impacts of municipal solid wastes in the Middle East and North Africa region, taking into account the future development of integrated waste management infrastructure involving collection, treatment and disposal. Mitigated and unmitigated disposal scenarios including waste growth reduction are used to estimate disposal methane emission changes at regional and subregional level. This study shows that unmitigated regional emissions by 2050 could rise to 296542 GgCO(2eq) from a current level in 2015 of 128184 GgCO(2eq) additionally decreasing annually by up to 8.75% falling to 10.16% due to waste characterisation changes as developing countries in the region progress to developed country status. A further annual rise, due to hotter drier climate conditions experienced as desertification, of up to a range of 1.70% increasing to 2.29% is also demonstrated.

15,"In support of an ambitious target to reduce carbon intensity by from 40 to 45 percent by the year 2020, as proposed by numerous leaders around the globe, various industries in China have come to think of carbon emissions reduction as an important part of their overall corporate strategy. As an energy-intense economic sector (Gossling, 2013), tourism is thus expected to play an important role in reducing CO2 emissions in China. However, low-carbon tourism in most destinations, and especially in newly emerging tourism destinations, is being neglected to some extent. Examples of this neglect can be found in such areas as China's Chengguan District of Lhasa, which has ambitions to become a world tourism centre. This study develops a fuzzy Delphi-ANP approach to suggest which low-carbon tourism strategy should be adopted in Chengguan District in the coming years. Applying our approach, we find that the priorities of low-carbon tourism strategies in Chengguan District are: first, economic development (0.1965), secondly, environmental construction (0.1593), and finally, social support (0.1442). Specifically, the importance of the indicators for tourism carbon intensity, low-carbon transportation, education regarding a low-carbon environment, carbon sink density and sewage treatment are stressed in this paper, in order to call for the immediate implementation of low-carbon tourism development in Chengguan District.

However, transportation mode choice studies are currently limited to micro-level and regional-level boundaries, lacking of presenting a complete picture of the issues and the root causes associated with urban passenger transportation choices in the U.S. To this end, further analysis from a system perspective is required to investigate the interdependencies among system parameters more thoroughly, thus revealing the underlying mechanisms contributing or causing the low public transportation use in the U.S. Hence, system dynamics modeling approach is utilized to capture complex causal relationships among the critical system parameters affecting public transportation ridership in the U.S. as well as to identify possible policy areas to improve public transportation ridership rates. Considering the high degree of uncertainties inherent to the problem, multivariate sensitivity analysis is utilized to explore the effectiveness of existing and possible policy implications up to the year 2050 in the terms of their potential to increase transit ridership and locating critical parameters that influences the most on mode choice and emission rates. Transportation mode choice behavior is projected to change slightly and reach up to a maximum of 7.25% of public transportation ridership until 2050. Analysis results reveal that the effects of trip length and rate are by far the most influential factors. Both parameters are 99% sensitive compared to all other factors including the effects of fuel tax policies, federal funds for public transportation, use of alternative green bus technologies, increasing private vehicle occupancy rates, etc. on negative environmental, economic, and social impacts of transportation.

18,"Planning for sustainable cities involves supporting compact, energy-efficient urban form as well as maintaining attractive and liveable urban landscapes. Attractive cities depend highly on services provided by ecosystems, especially cultural ecosystem services (ES), which give direct benefits to urban citizens. Therefore, access to a diversity of urban functions and publicly available ES by walking and public transport should be considered when planning for sustainable cities. This could be facilitated by user-friendly planning support models. The aim of this study was to develop a GIS-based model for assessing accessibility to ES, more specifically, water-related cultural ecosystem services (WCES), via walking and public transport, with input from stakeholders. The model was applied to the Stockholm region in Sweden. Travel times and census data were used to derive measures and maps of accessibility to prioritised WCES in the region, today and in urbanisation scenarios for 2050. The results showed how access to WCES varied spatially within the region. The number of potential visitors to different WCES sites now and in the future urbanisation scenarios was estimated, and areas in need for future development of the public transport system as well as WCES were identified.

19,"The performance of urban transport depends on a variety of factors related to metropolitan structure; in particular, the patterns of commuting, roads and public transport (PT) systems. To evaluate urban transport planning efforts, there is a need for a metric expressing the aggregate performance of the city's transport systems which should relate to residents' preferences. The existing metrics have typically focused on a measure to express the proximity of job locations to residences. A Transport Performance Index (TPI) is proposed in which the total cost of transportation system (operational and environmental costs) is divided by willingness to pay (WTP) for transport plus the willingness to accept (WTA) the environmental effects on residents. Transport operational as well as the environmental costs are derived from a simulation of all transport systems, to particular designs of spatial development. Willingness to pay for transport and willingness to accept the envirohmental effects are derived from surveys among residents. Simulations were modelled of Surabaya's spatial structure and public transport expansion. The results indicate that the current TPI is high, which will double by 2030. With a hypothetical polycentric city structure and adjusted job housing balance, a lower index occurs because of the improvements in urban transport performance. A low index means that the residents obtain much benefit from the alternative proposed. This illustrates the importance of residents' preferences in urban spatial planning in order to achieve efficient urban transport. Applying the index suggests that city authorities should provide fair and equitable public transport systems for suburban residents in the effort to control the phenomenon of urban sprawl. This index is certainly a good tool and prospective benchmark for measuring sustainability in relation to urban development.

20,"Although not yet a global consensus, there is widespread agreement that climate change is the result of anthropogenic sources of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. In order to respond to this issue, society has applied such strategies as clean energy development, improving industrial resource efficiency etc. Despite this, GHG emissions are still pursuing an upward trend. As the largest global GHG emitter, China faces a considerable challenge in responding to its agreed target of 40-45% GHG emission mitigation per unit gross domestic production (GDP) by 2020 as compared to 2005 levels. How to practically achieve this is still largely undecided. Comprehensive development of industrial symbiosis around nationwide is considered part of the solution. However, few researchers have studied how to actually implement a comprehensive development of industrial symbiosis for the purpose of GHG emission mitigation. This work intends to address this gap through highlighting the opportunities to develop such an approach for particular application to GHG emissions reduction in China. In addition, this study will also address the challenges ahead associated with the implementation of such a strategy, and outlines the where future research could be focused.

22,"Planning for a low-carbon future in Australia will need to address simultaneously three aspects of sustainable development: centralisation/regional development, mobility and communication. After reviewing existing roadmaps for low-carbon growth by 2050, the article identifies the importance for Australia of an integrated and mutually reinforcing set of measures, based on a bold approach to urban and regional planning. Taking account of national geography, the approach is based on the decentralisation of energy production, use and storage, and on new uses of communication, transport and the location of food, water and mineral resources. Revitalised regional centres could be connected, through new energy and transport solutions, by a national transport arc and electrified highways. The use of infrastructure funding to support low-carbon regional development would avoid the tragedy of the commons', transcending incremental, cumulative approaches based on compensation and incentives for household, business and sectoral abatement efforts.

23,"Among the first batch of pilot cities for application and promotion of new energy vehicles determined in 2013, Beijing is also a pilot city for national energy conservation, demonstration and popularization of new energy vehicles as well as subsidization of private new energy vehicles purchase. 2016 marks the beginning of the ""13th Five-Year Plan"" and is hence expected to be a pivotal year for promoting new energy vehicles. Using the Fuel Life Cycle Assessment, this paper conducts a quantitative analysis of such battery electric vehicles being promoted in Beijing as electric taxis, electric buses, electric sanitation trucks and rental battery electric vehicles, based on which we forecast the battery electric vehicles' performance during the ""13th Five-Year Plan"" in terms of energy conservation and emission reduction, as well as provide insights into the development path and the policy making for the industry accordingly. The results indicate a positive effect on energy conservation and emission reduction for all battery electric vehicles types currently on duty in Beijing, with an estimated 1.9 billion kilogram consumed energy of electricity conserved as well as 39.4 million tons of CO2 emission reduced by the end of 2020. Factors like power generation structure and fuel type are found to be crucial for this emission reduction performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

24,"The transition to more sustainable heating systems requires socio-technical approaches to strategic planning. Scenario development plays a key role in strategic planning, as the process supports the development of future visions and actions required for their realisation. However, new approaches to scenario development are required to address the limitations of conventional scenario development methods, such as the cognitive barriers of 'groupthink', reluctance to consider 'outside-the-box' options, handling of complexity, and ad hoc scenario selection and general non-transparency of scenario development processes. This paper describes the development and implementation of a novel method for scenario development and selection in the context of participatory strategic planning for sustainable heating in cities. The method is based on the morphological approach and a number of scenario criteria including transparency, reliability, coverage, completeness, relevanceldensity, creativity, interpretability, consistency, differentiation and plausibility. It integrates creativity workshops and interdisciplinary stakeholder participation to enhance the ownership and legitimacy of the scenarios. The approach entails the generation of a complete space of scenarios for heating systems and reduction of this space using cross-consistency analysis and project-specific requirements. Iterative development and implementation of the method is illustrated using two participatory backcasting projects focused on strategic planning for providing a comfortable indoor climate for Bila Tserkva, Ukraine, and Nis, Serbia by the year 2030. The results demonstrate that the method helps overcome the limitations of conventional approaches to scenario development and supports rigorous and transparent selection of a scenario set for participatory analysis. The method fostered the elicitation of consensus-based scenarios for more sustainable heating systems in both cities with regard to the quality of indoor comfort, environmental impact, resource efficiency and energy security.

25,"Low carbon energy supply technologies are increasingly used at the building and community scale and are an important part of the government decarbonisation strategy. However, with their present state of development and costs, many of these decentralised technologies rely on public subsidies to be financially viable. It is questionable whether they are cost effective compared to other ways of reducing carbon emissions, such as decarbonisation of conventional supply and improving the energy efficiency of dwellings. Previous studies have found it difficult to reliably estimate the future potential of decentralised supply because this depends on the available residential space which varies greatly within a city region. To address this problem, we used an integrated modelling framework that converted the residential density forecasts of a regional model into a representation of the building dimensions and land of the future housing stock. This included a method of estimating the variability of the dwellings and residential land. We present the findings of a case study of the wider south east regions of England that forecasted the impacts of energy efficiency and decentralised supply scenarios to year 2031. Our novel and innovative method substantially improves the spatial estimates of energy consumption compared to building energy models that only use standard dwelling typologies. We tested the impact of an alternative spatial planning policy on the future potential of decentralised energy supply and showed how lower density development would be more suitable for ground source heat pumps. Our findings are important because this method would help to improve the evidence base for strategies on achieving carbon budgets by taking into account how future residential space constraints would affect the suitability and uptakes of these technologies.

26,"This paper reports the insights into environmental impacts of the ongoing transformative land use and transport developments in Greater Beijing, from a new suite of dynamic land use, spatial equilibrium and strategic transport models that is calibrated for medium to long term land use and transport predictions. The model tests are focused on urban passenger travel demand and associated emissions within the municipality of Beijing, accounting for Beijing's land use and transport interactions with Tianjin, Hebei and beyond. The findings suggests that background trends of urbanization, economic growth and income rises will continue to be very powerful drivers for urban passenger travel demand across all main modes of transport beyond 2030. In order to achieve the dual policy aims for a moderately affluent and equitable nation and reducing the absolute levels of urban transport emissions by 2030, road charging and careful micro-level coordination between land use, built form and public transport provision may need to be considered together for policy implementation in the near future.

29,"Climate change is a major environmental threat of our time. Cities have a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions as most of the traffic, industry, commerce and more than 50% of world population is situated in urban areas. Southern Europe is a region that faces financial turmoil, enhanced migratory fluxes and climate change pressure. The case study of Thessaloniki is presented, one of the only two cities in Greece with established climate change action plans. The effects of feasible traffic policies in year 2020 are assessed and their potential health impact is compared to a business as usual scenario. Two types of measures are investigated: operation of underground rail in the city centre and changes in fleet composition. Potential co-benefits from reduced greenhouse gas emissions on public health by the year 2020 are computed utilizing state-of-the-art concentration response functions for PMx, NO2 and C6H6. Results show significant environmental health and monetary co-benefits when the city metro is coupled with appropriate changes in the traffic composition. Monetary savings due to avoided mortality or leukaemia incidence corresponding to the reduction in PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and C6H6 exposure will be 56.6, 45, 37.7 and 1.0 million Euros respectively. Promotion of 'green' transportation in the city (i.e. the wide use of electric vehicles), will provide monetary savings from the reduction in PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and C6H6 exposure up to 60.4, 49.1, 41.2 and 1.08 million Euros. Overall, it was shown that the respective GHG emission reduction policies resulted in clear co-benefits in terms of air quality improvement, public health protection and monetary loss mitigation.

30,"The transport sector is one of the fastest-growing energy-consuming sectors in the world and it contributes greatly to emissions of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e). In Bahrain, CO(2)e emissions from the transport sector grew by an average of 8% annually between 1994 and 2006. The aim of this research was to develop an integrated approach to assess the measures adopted to reduce CO(2)e emissions by the transport sector within the context of climate change mitigation. This approach used the multi-criteria analysis methodology of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to embed conventional assessment methods and a participatory approach. Three extensions to the original AHP methodology were developed: multi-AHP models, scenario packaging, and the examination of the plausibility of the results. The AHP results showed that certain fuel economy standards achieved the highest scores against five qualitative and quantitative criteria. Using socially and politically acceptable options, an integrated approach to CO(2)e mitigation could achieve a reduction in emissions of around 22% by 2030 (compared with 2010), at a cost of USD 112 per metric tonne of avoided CO(2)e emissions. Results from surveys of policymakers, experts, and the general public indicated that the outcomes of scenario packaging were plausible. The contributions of this research are two-fold. First, for the first time in Bahrain, the preferences of the general public have been considered and integrated with both the preferences of policymakers and experts and the results obtained from conventional assessment methods. Second, a structured approach for the integration of different assessment methods, transferable to other contexts, was developed and examined. Furthermore, multi-AHP models were introduced that can reflect the preferences of different concerned groups. Applications of this approach include assessment of the implementation of mitigation Measures that could affect a number of concerned groups, decision making in energy-consuming sectors, and development of mitigation policy packages.",WOS:000394920600016,2030,"{emiss, carbon, ghg}",383

32,"Environmental pressure from residential energy use is projected to significantly increase by 2030. Different environmental policy measures provide different incentives for ""environmentally responsive"" consumer choices and behavioural responses. There is a great energy saving potential in residential buildings of Lithuania. Compared to the other EU countries with similar climate conditions, energy consumption for residential heating is approximately 1.8 times higher in Lithuania. About 60% of Lithuanian population resides in multi-apartment buildings constructed during 1961-1990. The aim of the paper is to define the main drivers of residential energy use in Lithuania and to compare energy saving technologies in terms of energy saving potential and costs in Lithuanian residential buildings. Seeking to achieve the aim the main tasks of the paper are to analyse theoretical issues of the main drivers of residential energy use; to analyse residential energy use trends in Lithuania and to compare these trends with other EU member states; to define the main drivers of residential energy use by applying correlation analysis; to analyse policies aiming to reduce energy consumption in residential buildings and their impacts on GHG emission reduction. The comparative study of residential energy use in Lithuania and several old EU member states showed that residential energy use per capita in Lithuania is significantly lower than in old EU member states because of the lower income per capita and lower living standards. The economic and technological factors are the main driving forces of final energy consumption in all compared EU member states; however the impact of different factors varies between countries. The comparative analysis of energy saving and GHG emission reduction potential and costs in residential buildings provided by different studies showed that the most cost-effective instruments were appliance standards, energy efficiency obligations, Demand Side Management programs, public benefit charges and labelling.

33,The energy saving potential of the building stock is large and considered to be the most cost efficient to contribute to the CO2 reduction ambitions. Severe governmental policies steering on reducing the energy use seem essential to stimulate and enforce the improvement of the energy performance of buildings with a focus on reducing the heating and cooling energy demand. In Europe the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is a driving force for member states to develop and strengthen energy performance regulations for new buildings and energy certificates for the building stock. The goals are to build net zero energy new buildings in 2020 and to reach a neutral energy situation in the whole stock by 2050. More and more research projects deliver insight that the expected impact of stricter regulations for newly built houses is limited and the actual effects of energy savings through housing renovations stay behind the expectations. Theoretical energy use calculated on base of the design standard for new houses and assessment standards for Energy Performance Certificates of existing dwellings differ largely from the measured actual energy use. The paper uses the findings of some Post Occupancy Evaluation research projects.

Three scenarios are developed based on a detailed bottom-up modelling approach using a vintage stock model to simulate the energy demand of heating systems and appliances. The results show a decreasing final energy demand in the reference scenario from about 944 PJ in 2008 to 843 PJ in 2030. This reflects a structural break, which is mainly caused by a high building demolition rate and low efficiency in the existing building stock. The SEEP achieves additional savings of around 111 PJ until 2030, while a scenario with even higher efficiency shows further savings of 91 PJ. Electricity demand increases in all scenarios - mainly due to growing ownership rates of appliances.

Towards achieving these policies, this study evaluated the energy efficiency potential in the city, in collaboration with the district heating and electricity utility Fortum. Drawing on their vast billing meter data on the housing stock in Stockholm, a new understanding of energy use in the city emerged. Analysis of the energy efficiency potential of different building vintages revealed that the retrofitting potential of the building stock to current building codes would reduce heating energy use by one third. In terms of market segmentation, the greatest reduction potential in total energy was found to be for buildings constructed between 1946 and 1975. This is due to the large number of buildings constructed during that era and their poor energy performance. However, the least energy-efficient buildings were those built between 1926 and 1945 in contradiction to commonly held beliefs. These findings indicate the need for a shift in public policy towards the buildings with highest retrofitting potential. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Many sustainable urban forms have been studied and two of them, the compact city and the eco city, were chosen in this study as urban form foundations. Based on these forms, four sustainable city criteria (compactness, compatibility, dependency, and suitability) were considered as necessary functions for land use optimisation. This study presents a land use optimisation as a method for achieving a sustainable urban form. Three optimisation methods (particle swarm optimisation, genetic algorithms, and a local search method) were combined into a single hybrid optimisation method for land use in Bekasi city, Indonesia. It was also used for examining Bekasi city's land-use-plan (2010-2030) after optimising current (2015) and future land use (2030). After current land use optimisation, the score of sustainable city criteria increased significantly. Three important centres of land use (commercial, industrial, and residential) were also created through clustering the results.

45,"In the current study, Urban Equilibrium is defined as the situation where buildings in an urban environment act as a balancing agent for the greenhouse gas emissions of the urban area; therefore the buildings act like carbon pools. Cities contribute significantly to pollution, and the move to more, and larger, cities is increasing. The whole-of-life role of timber in future urban developments as a contributor to balance urban carbon emissions is considered here using a new concept of Urban Equilibrium. When applied to Auckland, New Zealand, as a case study, maximising the use of timber in future urban developments demonstrated that Auckland's target of a 40% carbon emissions reduction by 2040 could be achieved 20% faster than planned while still meeting the city's future growth needs. This strategy is complementary to, and easy to integrate with, other strategies and policies for greenhouse gas mitigation. However, the Urban Equilibrium concept is broader than this and can also be applied in other aspects relating to the sustainability of urban environments. Urban Equilibrium fosters a framework of urban governance that integrates environmental and social development agendas with economic development. This holistic approach takes into account the various effects that economic development can have, and re-defines the concept of growth to include a moral obligation to future generations.

46,"The Brazilian cities as well as many of the large urban centers in the world continue to expand, increasing the demand for mobility and transport, while, at the same time, the same cities are investing in greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation to avoid climate change. Brazil's urbanization rate increased from 26% in 1940 to almost 70% in 1980. During this period, the Brazilian population tripled and the urban population multiplied by seven. In 2010, the transport sector in SAo Paulo accounted for 71% of the total emissions released by the energy sector. Ethanol has been considered a fuel with less greenhouse gas emissions, when compared with fossil fuels. However, ethanol production would have to double to meet the expected demand. Electric vehicles (EVs) market is expanding around the world, and is also an option to reduce the transport emissions, if powered by clean electricity. To assess whether the adoption of EVs might bring more benefits than the current ethanol, we develop prospective scenarios supported by the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) simulation tool, taking a bottom-up tank-to-wheel approach to consider the CO2 emissions of car in SAo Paulo. The scenario considering a substitution of 25% of gasoline-powered cars by EV in 2030 showed a reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions, around 15% and 26% respectively in that year in comparison with 2015. We discuss the interplay between ethanol and EV, also considering emission coefficients from life cycle analysis conducted in Brazil, and concluded EV will have higher positive impact on climate change mitigation than ethanol.",WOS:000399689300005,2030,"{emiss, carbon, ghg}",383
47,"Transportation planning is changing. What used to be a concern with motorized vehicles only is evolving into a discipline dealing with multimodal systems where priority is given to transit and nonmotorized means of transport, chief among them being walking. The city of Bat Yam in Israel has chosen to pioneer planning for pedestrians as an integral component of its transportation master plan. This article presents a novel use of pedestrian movement modeling within urban transportation planning, by means of pedestrian movement volume prediction maps for the city, both at its current state today and at its future state planned for the year 2030. The study shows that a pedestrian movement distribution can be explained mainly by the spatial variables that represent properties of a street network. Changes to this network structure are relatively rare, and, therefore, pedestrian movement will not change in a fundamental way in the future. Furthermore, by overlaying the models for pedestrian movement and motorized traffic, as well as the underlying public transit and bicycle networks, focus can be on those streets and places where conflicts among the various road users (i.e., pedestrians, bicycles, transit vehicles, and private cars) are expected.",WOS:000343860100006,2030,"{bicycl, cycl, cyclist}",153
48,"Carbon dioxide emissions from human activities are the primary cause of recent climate change. In the United States, the road transportation sector is one of the largest sources of these emissions. Any policies to reduce emissions must therefore include mitigation strategies for on-road transportation. The aim of this paper is to propose a multi-criteria method, Analytical Hierarchy Process, to rank various on-road emissions mitigation strategies including reduce, avoid, and replace strategies. The method's results are obtained based on a survey of transportation and climate science professionals. The Analytical Hierarchy Process was applied to two regional scenarios of a midsize-small city (Lubbock, Texas) and a metropolitan area (Dallas, Texas). To evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies, the Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator model was run for Dallas. The aim of the model was to estimate the potential carbon dioxide mitigation for a given strategy allocation. Our survey identified no difference between the rankings of reduce, avoid, and replace strategies for our metropolitan and midsize-small city areas. Reduce strategies had the highest preference score of 40% followed by avoid strategies with 36% and replace strategies with 24%. An optimum mixed mitigation scenario would achieve reductions in carbon dioxide emissions of 17% by 2030 from 2010 levels. The contributions of this study are two-fold. First, we evaluate generic scenarios in detail and apply them to a real-world case study. Second, the approach is both simple and generalizable. Applications of this type of platform include ranking transportation strategies on mitigating carbon dioxide emissions, evaluating the strategies, prioritizing budgets, and developing assessments of mitigation potential.

This study employed AIM/Enduse model to investigate the CO2 reduction measures which are related to the marginal abatement cost (MAC) in the long term planning. Seven mitigation measures by replacing existing energy devices with more efficient ones based on the data currently available on the market are implemented: (1) efficient lighting devices, (2) efficient cooling devices, (3) efficient heating devices, (4) efficient other electrical devices, (5) efficient cooking devices, (6) Insulated houses, and (7) building codes. Results indicate that in the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario between 2010 and 2050, the energy demand and CO2 emissions would increase to 39,140 ktoe and 52,047 kt-CO2, respectively. By adopting these policy strategies, energy demand can be reduced by about 42.7% of total energy demand in 2050 while CO2 emissions can be mitigated by 35.0% of overall CO2 emissions in 2050.

Increasing population and prosperity lead to a steadily growing energy demand and thereby increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. One third of the province's final energy consumption comes from the transport sector, dominated by motorized individual transport. Due to the limited financial resources to fund public transport initiatives, the most cost-effective means to reach the GHG mitigation targets are intended, without jeopardizing the economic growth. Recently, a bus rapid transit (BRT) system (Rea Vaya) and a rapid rail link (Gautrain) have been introduced to enforce the public transport system. In this paper, we investigate planned and possible future network expansions of the BRT and the Gautrain in terms of transport performance, costs of network expansions and GHG mitigation potential. Based on a trip rate model, we show that extensions of the current network can increase passenger numbers significantly (between 320% and 660% between 2013 and 2040 depending on the framework conditions). However, despite these expansions, the modal share of the BRT and the Gautrain in total passenger-kilometres travelled remains below 4% until 2040. This results in a decrease of cumulated GHG emissions of less than 1% until 2040 and relatively high GHG mitigation costs (4948-30045 ZAR(2013)/t CO(2)e). Nevertheless, a better integration of all public transport systems can increase the attractiveness of the services, which can result in a higher modal shift from private cars and thereby higher GHG emissions reductions at lower costs.

55,"Rapid economic development and urbanization has led to a tremendous carbon emissions increase. The development of the Yellow River Delta High-efficient Eco-economic Zone (YRDHEZ), according to its plan, would be accompanied by a sharp economic increase and new pattern of urbanization. This paper, based on IPCC guidelines, explored the carbon emissions trajectory in YRDHEZ from 2005 to 2011 from 6 sectors (industrial energy consumption, fugitive emissions, transportation, industrial processes, livestock emissions, and waste), and predicted its carbon emissions in 2015 and 2020 based on the development plan. The results showed that total carbon emissions substantially increased from 2005 to 2011 and it would still increase in 2015 and 2020, with the largest emissions sector coming from industrial energy consumption. The carbon emissions intensity decreased from 2005 to 2011, and would decrease in 2015 and 2020. The carbon emissions intensity reduction rate would fail to meet the national target of 40-45% reduction in 2020 compared to the level in 2005 if no further mitigation methods were adopted. To increase the mitigation of carbon emissions, universal and unique methods were proposed in YRDHEZ: industrial structure adjustment, energy efficiency improvement, and adoption of renewable energy; transformation of reserve land into eco-land; and the employment of carbon capture and storage technology in the future. These results and implications would provide valuable suggestions for development of YRDHEZ. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",WOS:000341348600009,2020,"{emiss, carbon, ghg}",383
56,"According to the recast of the Energy Performance Building Directive, Member States must give an exact definition for nearly zero-energy buildings to be introduced from 2018/2020. The requirement system stipulating the sustainable development of the building sector is usually based on the analysis of a few reference buildings, combining energy efficiency measures and HVAC systems. The risk of this method is that depending on the assumptions either the requirements do not provide sufficient incentives for energy saving measures and renewables or the requirements cannot be fulfilled with rational solutions in many cases. Our method is based on the artificial generation of a large building sample, where the buildings are defined by geometric and other parameters. Due to the large number of combinations, the effect of many variables appear in the results, with the deviations reflecting the sensitivity of the energy balance. The requirements are set based on some fundamental considerations and the statistical analysis of the sample. The method is demonstrated on the example of setting the requirements for residential buildings in Hungary. The proposed requirements are validated against the common European targets.

57,"Many vehicle owners in the United States recharge their vehicles' air conditioning systems with small containers of hydrofluorocarbon-134a (HFC-134a, CH2FCF3), at a frequency estimated to be once every year on average. Such nonprofessional service produces immediate emissions of this potent greenhouse gas during service and from the residual heel in partially used containers. The nonprofessional operations are also associated with increased delayed refrigerant emissions that occur because owners are less likely to repair leaks than professional technicians. In California, an estimated 1.3 million nonprofessional service operations performed each year generate 0.27 +/- 0.07 million metric ton CO2 equivalent (MMTCO(2)e) of immediate emissions and 0.54 +/- 0.08 MMTCO(2)e of delayed emissions, using a Global Warming Potential of 1300 for HFC-134a. The immediate emissions can be largely mitigated by a regulation that requires self-sealing valves and improved labeling instructions on the containers, a deposit-return-recycling program for the containers, and a consumer education program. If 95% of the used containers were to be returned by consumers for recycling of the container heel, the annual immediate emissions would be reduced by 0.26 +/- 0.07 MMTCO(2)e. In the United States, an estimated 24 million nonprofessional service operations are performed each year, generating 5.1 +/- 1.4 MMTCO(2)e of immediate emissions and 10.4 +/- 1.5 MMTCO(2)e of delayed emissions. Mitigation measures equivalent to the California regulation would reduce nationwide immediate emissions by 4.9 +/- 1.4 MMTCO(2)e, if 95% of the used cans were returned for recycling. These business-as-usual emissions and mitigation potentials are projected to stay approximately constant until around 2022, and remain at significant levels into the 2030s. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Nowadays, the capital intensive infrastructure investments, such as the expansion of district heating networks and the introduction of significant heat saving measures require highly detailed decision-support tool. A Danish heat atlas provides highly detailed database with extensive information about more than 2.5 million buildings in Denmark. Energy system analysis tools incorporate environmental, economic, energy and engineering analysis of future energy systems and are considered crucial for the quantitative assessment of transitional scenarios towards future milestones, such as EU 2020 goals and Denmark's goal of achieving fossil free society after 2050. The present paper shows how a Danish heat atlas can be used for providing inputs to energy system models, especially related to the analysis of heat saving measures within building stock and expansion of district heating networks. As a result, marginal cost curves are created, approximated and prepared for the use in optimization energy system model. Moreover, it is concluded that heat atlas can contribute as a tool for data storage and visualisation of results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper analyses the emerging paradoxes in the BRT system in Dar as Salaam city where the provision of an organized, affordable and cost-effective public transport system has been eagerly awaited by city residents. However, the Dar Rapid Transit (DART) system, recently established, has astonishingly witnessed opposition from some of the city residents. Findings reveal that the underlying reasons for this paradoxical situation include absence of a current land use plan, ineffective land use control and little adherence to the legal provision for property compensation and resettlement. Lack of common understanding between the government and the affected people, deters the implementation of Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system in the city.

63,"Defining Car Dependency (CD) as a lack of travel choices to daily destinations, this paper explores how possible changes in the spatial context of a post-growth, mid-sized urban region can affect the conditions for CD. In the most rural parts of the region distances to schools and shops will exceed walking and biking distances. Distances to work will increase on average. With the bicycle and e-bicycle fewer jobs will be accessible, although the e bicycle shows greater reach than public transport. Despite the population and job decline, more jobs will be accessible by car, as a result of current investments in road infrastructure. This is enhanced by the ongoing development of economic centers along the highways, resulting in a growing mismatch between the rail system and the spatial economic structure of the region. We developed policy scenarios to explore spatial conditions for reducing car-dependence within the region. Intensifying land uses along the axes of public transport has a limited effect in a shrinking region. Introducing direct and fast public transport connections to the existing economic centers however does have effect. We tested two transport policy scenarios, one based on improving Inter City (IC) rail services on the existing rail network and one based on creating Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) services on the existing highways. The IC-scenario makes more jobs accessible outside the current daily urban system, while the BRT-scenario intensifies relations within the region. With regards to CD 'three worlds' seem to be emerging in this medium-sized, 'post growth' region. Rural areas (10-15% of the population in 2030) are increasingly becoming completely car dependent, suburban areas (65 -75% of the population) are offering travel choices to daily amenities, but increasingly becoming more car dependent in relation to jobs, and central urban areas (15-20% of the population) are providing travel choices to amenities as well as jobs, but only under the condition of improving the regional public transport system.",WOS:000395954200007,2030,"{travel, mode, choic}",332

How much energy can be saved in the building sector through implementation of energy polices? These questions are critical for government development strategies and planning. Thus, in this paper, an econometric model (co-integration technique) is developed to analyze how China's BEC is affected by macroeconomic variables in the context of urbanization, and also forecast the BEC and BEE potential until 2020 under different scenarios. The research result shows that occupants' lifestyles, residents' living standards, and energy price have significant influences on BEC.

66,"By 2020, the vehicle population in China will likely exceed 280 million exacerbating national energy security, urban air pollution, and traffic congestion. In response, many local and regional governments in China are pursuing an expanding array of measures to restrain growth in personal vehicle ownership and, along with the central government, reducing emissions and energy use of vehicles. One prominent strategy is the promotion of new energy vehicles, especially plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). Large subsidies were offered up to $27,600 (171,000 RMB) per vehicle in some regions, including almost $9200 (57,000 RMB) from the central government which suggests that China is making a major commitment to PEVs. But sales have been meager. In 2013, only 17,600 PEVs, mostly buses and utility trucks, were sold, less than 0.1% of total civilian vehicle sales. Several factors explain the failure of PEV sales to take off: (1) protectionism by local governments; (2) uncertainty over which electric-drive vehicle technologies to promote and what consumers are willing to pay, (3) lagging investments in charging infrastructure, and (4) conservative investment behavior by automakers and battery manufacturers. The central government issued directives to local governments in late 2013 to reduce barriers to out-of-town companies, resulting in modest sales increases in early 2014, but a more coherent, broader, and effective set of policies, incentives, and strategies are needed to overcome consumer and industry resistance and the lack of charging infrastructure.

67,"Emissions from the transport sector represent the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions. There is little prospect that this situation will be resolved with a single technological fix. As developing nations quickly move to catch up with the motorization levels of developed nations, the sheer number of private vehicles may overwhelm any advances made by cleaner fuels. By 2030, there is projected to be more vehicles in the developing world than in developed nations.

In particular, the analysis compares the cost of greenhouse gas emission reductions from fuel technology options to reductions from measures promoting mode shifting. This comparative analysis indicates that a diversified package of measures with an emphasis on mode shifting is likely to be the most cost-effective means to greenhouse gas emission reductions.",WOS:000234359100004,2030,"{emiss, carbon, ghg}",383
68,"The pressuring need to reduce the import of fossil fuels as well as the need to dramatically reduce CO2 emissions in Europe motivated the European Commission (EC) to implement several regulations directed to building owners. Most of these regulations focus on increasing the number of energy efficient buildings, both new and retrofitted, since retrofits play an important role in energy efficiency. Overall, this initiative results from the realization that buildings will have a significant impact in fulfilling the 20/20/20-goals of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, increasing energy efficiency by 20%, and increasing the share of renewables to 20%, all by 2020.The Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model (DER-CAM) is an optimization tool used to support DER investment decisions, typically by minimizing total annual costs or CO2 emissions while providing energy services to a given building or microgrid site. This paper shows enhancements made to DER-CAM to consider building retrofit measures along with DER investment options. Specifically, building shell improvement options have been added to DER-CAM as alternative or complementary options to investments in other DER such as PV, solar thermal, combined heat and power, or energy storage. The extension of the mathematical formulation required by the new features introduced in DER-CAM is presented and the resulting model is demonstrated at an Austrian Campus building by comparing DERCAM results with and without building shell improvement options. Strategic investment results are presented and compared to the observed investment decision at the test site. Results obtained considering building shell improvement options suggest an optimal weighted average U value of about 0.53 W/(m(2) K) for the test site. This result is approximately 25% higher than what is currently observed in the building, suggesting that the retrofits made in 2002 were not optimal. Furthermore, the results obtained with DER-CAM illustrate the complexity of interactions between DER and passive measure options, showcasing the need for a holistic optimization approach to effectively optimize energy costs and CO2 emissions. The simultaneous optimization of building shell improvements and DER investments enables building owners to take one step further towards nearly zero energy buildings (nZEB) or nearly zero carbon emission buildings (nZCEB), and therefore support the 20/20/20 goals.

69,"In order to meet the recycling and recovery targets set forth by the European Union's (EU) Waste and Landfill Directives, both the Irish and Czech governments' policy on waste management is changing to meet these pressures, with major emphasis being placed upon the management of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW). In particular, the EU Landfill Directive requires reductions in the rate of BMW going to landfill to 35% of 1995 values by 2016 and 2020 for Ireland and the Czech Republic, respectively. In this paper, the strategies of how Ireland and the Czech Republic plan to meet this challenge are compared. Ireland either landfills or exports its waste for recovery, while the Czech Republic has a relatively new waste management infrastructure. While Ireland met the first target of 75% diversion of BMW from landfill by 2010 and preliminary 2012 data indicate that Ireland is on track to meet the 2013 target, the achievement of the 2016 target remains at risk. Indicators that were developed to monitor the Czech Republic's path to meeting the targets demonstrate that it did not meet the first target that was set for 2010 and will probably not meet its 2013 target either. The evaluation reports on the implementation of Waste Management Plan of Czech Republic suggest that the currently applied strategy to divert biodegradable waste from landfill is not effective enough. For both countries, the EU Waste Framework and Landfill Directives will be a significant influence and driver of change in waste management practices and governance over the coming decade. This means that both countries will not only have to invest in infrastructure to achieve the targets, but will also have to increase awareness among the public in diverting this waste at the household level. Improving environmental education is part of increased awareness as it is imperative for citizens to understand the consequences of their actions as affluence continues to grow producing increased levels of waste.

Five alternative future scenarios are represented in the GB national transport model and forecasts are obtained for trip making, traffic levels, congestion and emissions in 2030. For all scenarios it is expected that there will be significant traffic growth. Traffic growth is restricted most in scenarios including distance-based road charging on motorways and trunk roads. However, congestion and carbon dioxide emissions are most effectively limited in scenarios with congestion-based road charging, major improvements to urban public transport and investment in new fuel technologies and in improving engine efficiency.

In this paper, the possibilities to implement new policies to improve the efficiency of electricity end-use are explored.The following policy actions are considered:introduction of a '1 W standard' for standby power consumption of appliances,incremental standards for large electric appliances,design guidelines for small electric appliances,a technology-forcing standard for lighting,a motor-drive program.a program directed at the reduction of electricity use during empty-office hours,actual energy performance requirements for service-sector buildings.The implementation of these programs will contribute substantially to reaching greenhouse gas emission targets in the European Union (total estimated effect to be 200-350 Mton CO2 emission reduction in the year 2020).However, to reach these targets a very substantial effort is required, both in terms of policy ambition, force of the applied instruments. and implementation efforts. In the case of electric appliances, regulatory instruments may need wider application. And, in order to attain the substantial potential savings in motor-drive systems, an effort comparable to the effort to promote renewable electricity in the European Union may be both justified and necessary.

In the last four years, management of waste water has changed dramatically and entire city neighborhoods have been connected to a conventional sewer system. In this paper, the effects of this measure on long-term groundwater quality development of the aquifers underlying Sana'a and, more specifically, on water quality of the public supply peri-urban wellfields are analyzed. The results, obtained with a transient groundwater model, indicated that by 2020 the construction of the sewerage will have considerably reduced the area polluted by groundwater, but the process is slow. Furthermore, construction of the sewerage will hardly affect the groundwater quality of the wellfields, since flow is not directed towards most of the production wells. The Yemeni authorities should realize that less expensive sanitation alternatives are available, but they need user participation, which, in turn, would raise public awareness that water supplies and sanitation are not to be seen as solely a government responsibility.",WOS:000244443300008,2020,"{water, heat, suppli}",145

The MARKAL model was used to forecast energy consumption and emissions of local air pollutants under different energy policy scenarios and also to analyze the associated reductions in CO2 emissions. The results show that energy policies in Shanghai will significantly reduce SO2 and PM10 emissions and will also achieve the co-benefit of mitigating the increase of CO2 emissions. In energy policy scenarios, SO2 emissions during the period 2000-2020 will maintain the same level as in 2000; and the annual rate of increase of CO2 emissions will be reduced to 1.1-1.2%, compared with 2.7% under a business-as-usual scenario. The problem for the future will be NOx emissions. which are projected to increase by 60-70% by 2020, due to expansion of the transportation system. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Separate models including air pollution models and comparative risk assessment health models were developed to link alternative transport scenarios with possible environmental and health benefits.Results: In the study region with an estimated population of 1.4 million in 2030, by shifting 40% of vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT) by passenger vehicles to alternative transport, annual average urban PM2.5 would decline by approximately 0.4 mu g/m(3) compared to business-as-usual, resulting in net health benefits of an estimated 13 deaths/year prevented and 118 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) prevented per year due to improved air quality. Further health benefits would be obtained from improved physical fitness through active transport (508 deaths/year prevented, 6569 DALYs/year prevented), and changes in traffic injuries (21 deaths and, 960 DALYs prevented).Conclusion: Although uncertainties remain, our findings suggest that significant environmental and health benefits are possible if alternative transport replaces even a relatively small portion of car trips.

A scenario that involves adopting more efficient energy using practices and technologies is estimated to produce CO2 emissions 50% above 1990 levels, A scenario with powerful incentives for energy efficiency could lead to CO2 emissions 28% above 1990 levels, Much of the CO2 growth is the result of population growth and growth in energy services, especially in developing countries, Policy instruments to reduce energy use and related CO2 emissions include real increases in energy prices, aggressive use of energy efficiency policies, major programs to transfer knowledge, technology, and tools for transforming markets to the developing world and continued efforts to pursue research and development in technologies and practices to increase energy efficiency in buildings.

81,"The future for people lies increasingly in and around cities. Government actions within cities, including those assisted by aid efforts, have tended to concentrate on a few key services. Those services have been remarkably similar over time, consisting of public health services, public transport, sanitation, solid waste management and water supply. The provision of those services, and the needs for government intervention, has been historically justified on grounds of economic development, environmental sustainability or social equity. This article addresses the hypothesis that the core concerns of providing a better environment have changed little over 50 years (nor indeed since the great influenza epidemic that struck India and Britain in the late 1840s). The question it poses is whether those concerns will change much over the next 50 years. The magnitude will be greater; by 2050 it is likely that three out of four people will live in or near cities. Priorities, technologies and management methods appear to have undergone great changes. The language of urban or environmental management has also changed. How important have been those changes? How new are the current concerns with the new public management, private financing of public services, public-private partnerships, service inclusion and targeting the poor, or participatory development? The article highlights the need to view current means to manage the environments of essentially poor people in the context of the ends and purpose of such management. It reviews articles in PAD and other writings to examine the interplay between ends and means in the past. This may help predict likely future directions, not perhaps over the next 50, but possibly over the next 10 years.

83,"Wasatch Choices 2040 was a partnership between Envision Utah and the two major metropolitan planning organizations along Utah's Wasatch Front. The purpose of the partnership was to involve the public through a scenario planning process and to consider the role of land use in developing the region's long-range transportation plan. Through :13 public workshops and 5 open houses held in 2005, members of the public expressed their preferences for transportation and land use in their communities. The input from the public informed the development of regional growth principles that have since been adopted by elected officials and will guide transportation and land use decisions in Wasatch Front communities. In addition, results from the public process were used to create four regional transportation and land use scenarios that ultimately led to the creation of a regional vision. Each scenario was tested by using the CentreSim forecasting model, and a vision scenario was created to depict one version of how the Wasatch Front could develop if guided by regional growth principles. Modeling of the regional vision demonstrates that it performs significantly better than the existing long-range plan for several quality-of-life measures, including traffic congestion. This process proved groundbreaking by reminding both land use and transportation professionals that futures cannot be planned in isolation. Transportation affects land use just as much as land use affects transportation. It is a circular relationship that must be accounted for.

Though city efforts to reduce global warming potential (GWP) emissions may be low in the global context, effective transportation policies in cities will have obvious results. Taking the Kathmandu Valley as a case study, this paper makes an attempt to analyse the implication of different transportation policies for reducing vehicular emissions and energy consumption. This paper estimates and analyses current and future trends of energy demand and environmental emissions, especially CO2 and PM10 from passenger road transportation in the Kathmandu Valley. The study is based on the primary data collected at the busiest and longest inner city road. It uses the long range energy alternatives planning system framework to construct future scenarios up to 2025. It analyses future scenario implications mainly dealing with the introduction of trolley buses, promotion of public transportation, discouraging private vehicles and low occupancy public vehicles, increasing vehicular speed, and other transportation policies. The study estimated that the 637 million passenger-kilometres traveled in the study route during 2004 resulted in 34.8 million kg of CO2 emissions. The travel demand is estimated to multiply by 7.8 with a corresponding twelve-fold increase in CO2 emissions and a ten-fold increase in total suspended particles (TSP) emissions in the study route from 2004 to 2024 under a non-intervention scenario. This scenario analysis suggests that discouraging private vehicles, thereby promoting mass transportation operated by electricity, can reduce CO2 by 43.7% and TSP by 43.8% compared with a scenario of non-intervention. In addition to transportation policies, effective land-use planning and encouragement of non-motorised transport can have more positive impacts.

85,"Motor vehicle ownership and utilization are growing rapidly in Asia, because of rapid urbanization and growing urban incomes. This sudden growth is resulting in increasing traffic congestion, fuel use, and CO2 emissions and in deteriorating air quality. This paper presents a common framework to explore scenarios of vehicle and energy use and emissions in three South Asian cities: Bangalore, India; Colombo, Sri Lanka; and Dhaka, Bangladesh. Scenarios are built by separately analyzing transportation activity (in tonne kilometers or passenger kilometers), modal structure (i.e., share of tonne kilometers or passenger kilometers occurring on each mode), modal energy intensity (in energy burned per tonne kilometer or passenger kilometer), and emission factors. Although the types of data available across cities vary widely and there are deficiencies and inconsistencies in the available data, the analysis suggests that motor vehicle use would roughly double in each city by 2020 in the business-as-usual scenario, largely because of expected income increases; fuel use and CO2 emissions would triple; and pollution loading would rise exponentially. An alternative scenario of slower vehicle and energy growth is explored, premised on substitution of personal vehicles with buses and reduction in traffic congestion. Consequently, fuel use and CO2 emissions would only double in Bangalore and Dhaka, whereas in Colombo the increase would not be significantly lower than in the business-as-usual scenario. The cumulative carbon mitigation potential over a 15-year period would be 13% in Bangalore, 9% in Dhaka, and 2% in Colombo.

This study sheds light on the state of urban climate change adaptation and mitigation planning across Europe. Europe is an excellent test case given its advanced environmental policies and high urbanization. We performed a detailed analysis of 200 large and medium-sized cities across 11 European countries and analysed the cities' climate change adaptation and mitigation plans. We investigate the regional distribution of plans, adaptation and mitigation foci and the extent to which planned greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions contribute to national and international climate objectives. To our knowledge, it is the first study of its kind as it does not rely on self-assessment (questionnaires or social surveys). Our results show that 35 % of European cities studied have no dedicated mitigation plan and 72 % have no adaptation plan. No city has an adaptation plan without a mitigation plan. One quarter of the cities have both an adaptation and a mitigation plan and set quantitative GHG reduction targets, but those vary extensively in scope and ambition. Furthermore, we show that if the planned actions within cities are nationally representative the 11 countries investigated would achieve a 37 % reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, translating into a 27 % reduction in GHG emissions for the EU as a whole. However, the actions would often be insufficient to reach national targets and fall short of the 80 % reduction in GHG emissions recommended to avoid global mean temperature rising by 2 A degrees C above pre-industrial levels.",WOS:000328622900026,2050,"{climat, chang, mitig}",176
87,"The modelling of land use change is a way to analyse future scenarios by modelling different pathways. Application of spatial data of different scales coupled with socio-economic data makes it possible to explore and test the understanding of land use change relations. In the EU-FP7 research project PASH-MINA (Paradigm Shift modelling and innovative approaches), three storylines of future transportation paradigm shifts towards 2040 are created. These storylines are translated into spatial planning strategies and modelled using the cellular automata model LUCIA. For the modelling, an Eastern Danish case area was selected, comprising of the Copenhagen metropolitan area and its hinterland. The different scenarios are described using a range of different descriptive GIS datasets. These include mapping of accessibility based on public and private transportation, urban density and structure, and distribution of jobs and population. These indicators are then incorporated in the model calculations as factors determining urban development, related to the scenario outlines. The results calculated from the scenarios reveals the great difference in urban distribution that different spatial planning strategies can produce, changing the shape of the urban landscape. The scenarios visualized showed to outline different planning strategies that could be implemented, creating a more homogenous urban structure targeted at a reduction of transportation work and thus energy consumption. This will lead to less impact on climate from transportation based on a more optimal localization and transport infrastructure strategy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

88,"The building sector has a significant share in a county's total greenhouse gas emissions, and as a reaction to the Kyoto commitment most countries are constantly adjusting building energy requirements in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the climate change. While it is easier to set standards for the building fabric and for technical systems, the impact of occupants on comfort and energy performance in buildings has proven to be important, but is a lot harder to account for. This paper therefore aims to investigate the magnitude of influence of occupants in relation to climate and architectural design on thermal comfort and CO2 emissions in offices in different climate zones of the world. The aim is to identify typical patterns and key parameters for optimisation.For this purpose, a parametric study for a typical cellular office room has been conducted using the simulation software EnergyPlus. Two different occupant scenarios are each compared with three different architectural design variations and modelled in the context of three different locations for the IPCC climate change scenario A2 for 2030. The evaluation of the results is focused on two different modes of operation. For natural ventilation adaptive thermal comfort according to ASHRAE Standard 55 has been evaluated, and for mixed mode operation final energy consumption and resulting CO2 emissions. The results indicate a first approach to estimate comfort levels based on climatic data, architectural design priorities and occupancy. Additionally, warmer climates seem to have larger optimisation potential for comfort and energy performance in offices compared to colder climates. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

There are many problems with this system of transportation and dependence on the private car, including environmental, social and city design dimensions. Though there is a clear aspiration to move towards reduced levels of car usage in the city's transport and spatial planning strategies, there are major difficulties in implementation terms. We develop and consider future scenarios to 2041 to reduce these levels of motorization, and subsequent transport CO2 emissions, with a much greater use of public transport, walking and cycling, urban planning, and low emission vehicles. The current implementability of such a 'sustainable mobility' future is however questioned in the current political and social context, and critically debated in terms of the available governance mechanisms and the limited attempts to shape the behaviour of the public.

The paper further compares the requirements of the Passivhaus construction standard, which is highlighted by the European Union as an example of residential buildings with virtually zero energy consumption (nearly zero-energy buildings), similarly to the buildings that European countries will be forced to build by 2020.Within the current regulations, the thermal transmittance is the only factor that is used to compare the thermal insulation of buildings. However, this paper demonstrates that the thermal transmittance is not a valid parameter for the comparison and harmonization of the envelope energy losses because countries set different transmittance values for each climate zone, which are defined on the basis of different ranges of degree-day variation and are calculated using different base temperatures. Furthermore, this paper proposes a new methodology that can be used to regulate the thermal insulation of buildings to ultimately harmonize the envelope energy losses across all countries.

92,"The building sector is the dominant energy consumer with a total 30% share of the overall energy consumption and accounts for one-third of the greenhouse gas emissions around the world. Moreover, in recent years the energy demands for buildings have increased very rapidly due to increase in the growth rate of population and improvement in living standards of people. Furthermore, fossil fuels will continue to dominate the world's primary energy by 2030. Thus, the increase in energy demand, shortage of fossil fuels and environmental concerns has provided impetus to the development of sustainable building and renewable energy resources. Thermal energy storage is an efficient method for applying to building envelopes to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. This, in turn, reduces the environmental impact related to energy usage.The combination of construction materials and PCM is an efficient way to increase the thermal energy storage capacity of construction elements. Therefore, an extensive review on the incorporation of PCM into construction materials and elements by direct incorporation, immersion, encapsulation, shape-stabilization and form-stable composite PCMs is presented. For the first time, the differentiation between shape-stabilized and form-stable composite PCM has been made. Moreover, various construction materials such as diatomite, expanded perlite and graphite, etc. which are used as supports for formstable composite PCM along with their worldwide availability are extensively discussed. One of the main aims of this review paper is to focus on the test methods which are used to determine the chemical compatibility, thermal properties, thermal stability and thermal conductivity of the PCM. Hence, the details related to calibration, sample preparation, test cell and analysis of test results are comprehensively covered. Finally, because of the renewed interest in integration of PCM in wallboards and concrete, an up-to-date review with focus on PCM enhanced wallboard and concrete for building applications is added.

95,"The objective of this paper was to examine the profit levels, energy use and environmental impacts of two residential development scenarios in a watershed in the Philadelphia region under two zoning assumptions. The two scenarios were based on economic suitability and environmental suitability. A key question was whether these occurred together in the Pennypack Creek Watershed. Suitability analyses in ArcGIS using criteria for profit and for local sustainability parsed out two sets of developable areas. Buildouts to satisfy 2035 population projections in these areas using CommunityViz software were based on actual municipal zoning ordinances. In a unified zoning scheme created by the authors, a density-adjusted number of housing units are placed watershed-wide without municipal restrictions. Profit data for buildings in each zip code were used to compute a Weighted Profit per Square Meter. Household units were associated with a particular type of automobile and average Vehicle Kilometers Traveled in the relevant census tracts. The GREET program was used to compute energy use, air pollution emissions and greenhouse gas emissions. A Weighted Water Quality Index and Index of Biological Integrity were used to assess water-related impacts based on recent monitoring data supplied by the Philadelphia Water Department. It was no surprise that ECON-UNI and ECON-MUNI generated higher profit than ENV-MUNI and ENV-UNI. ENV-UNI had lower energy use and environmental impacts than all others. That ECON-MUNI had the second lowest energy use and environmental impacts, and the highest water quality, was unexpected. Some policy proposals and conclusions end the paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

99,"One goal of the Swedish energy policy is to reduce the amount of electricity used for heating in the building sector. This means to reduce the primary energy used for heating which in this paper is analyzed in the context of various heating technologies and CO2 emissions. The analysis is applied to a region in Sweden (southern Sweden) for which detailed information on the energy infrastructure (the capital stock of the buildings and heating systems together with geographical variations in heat intensity) is available from a previous work [Johansson, P., Nylander, A., Johnsson, F., 2005. Electricity dependency and CO2 emissions from heating in the Swedish building sector-current trends in conflict with governmental policy? Energy policy] and which is large enough to be assumed representative for Sweden as a whole. The detailed mapping of the energy infrastructure allows a good estimate on the rate at which the energy system can be expected to be replaced with respect to economical lifetime of the capital stock (the year 2025 in this case). Two scenarios are investigated; a: target scenario for which energy savings are employed (e.g. improving climate shell in buildings) and oil and most of the electricity used for heating purposes are phased out and a second for which the current trend in the heating market continues.In the target scenario it is shown that although only applying commercially competitive heating technologies, it is possible to achieve a 47% reduction in primary energy use for heating with a 34% decrease in heat demand together with significant reduction in CO2 emissions. However, the scenario which continues the current trends on the heating market instead yields an increase (of about 10%) in primary energy use (reduction in conversion efficiency) of the heating system of the region over the period studied, in spite of a slight decrease in heat demand (9%, mainly due to energy efficiency measures) as well as in CO2 emissions. In light of the recently proposed introduction of energy performance certification of buildings in Sweden (and in EU), it can be concluded that such a certification system must take into account the primary energy use and local conditions. A politically acceptable way to do so would be to propose municipalities to develop ""best strategies"" on development of the heating market for various house types and districts within the municipality which can then be included as recommendations in the energy performance certification of the buildings.

Among the ten largest cities in the world in terms of population sizes, three are in Southeast Asia alone and more than one in two people will be living in cities in 2025. These primate cities - Metro-Manila in the Philippines, Jakarta in Indonesia and Bangkok in Thailand - are seeing not only rapid rates of in-migration but also rapid expansion and urban sprawl. Such rapid rates of change pose growing challenges to Southeast Asian cities including smaller capital cities like Kuala Lumpur, Ho Chi Minh City and Singapore.

101,"There is a growing sense of urgency internationally about cutting greenhouse gas emissions. If New Zealand is to continue to position itself as a truly sustainable nation, it will need to take radical and effective steps to reduce its transport-related carbon dioxide emissions. Even if New Zealand were not to take early action, it is likely that it would come under strong international pressure to stay in step with progressive countries. The government has recently committed, in principle, to cutting domestic transport related emissions by 50 percent by 2040, but it is not yet clear that the measures the government has proposed will get New Zealand to this target. This paper examines the policy opportunities provided by urban form and transport, arguing that these issues have been little explored to date in New Zealand in terms of their potential to reduce carbon emissions, and provide co-benefits such as health gains and cost savings.

102,"Mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from transportation has become increasingly important and challenging especially for developing countries. This paper takes the inter-city passenger transport in China as a case, and develops a system dynamics model for policy assessment and CO2 mitigation potential analysis. It is found that the future demand for China's inter-city passenger transport is expected to be large, with the turnover volume growing at a rate of 9% per annum and amounting to 6600 billion p-km in 2020. Major emissions reduction potential exists in inter-city passenger transport. In 2020, comparing to the case without any specific policies stressing mitigation, the reduction Of CO2 emissions ranges from 26% to 32% under those scenarios with policy controls. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the CO2 mitigation will be best achieved by accelerating the development of railway network, together with slowing down the extension of highway network and imposing fuel taxes.

103,"This paper presents insight into the benefits of organic waste recycling through composting over landfill, in terms of landfill life extension, compost product, and mitigation of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Future waste generation from 2003 to 2020 was forecast, and five scenarios of organic waste recycling in the municipality of Phnom Penh (MPP), Cambodia, were carried out. Organic waste specifically food and garden waste was used for composting, and the remaining waste was landfilled. The recycling scenarios were set based on organic waste generated from difference sources: households, restaurants, shops, markets, schools, hotels, offices, and street sweeping. Through the five scenarios, the minimum volume reductions of waste disposal were about 56, 123, and 219 m(3) d(-1) in 2003, 2012, and 2020, respectively, whereas the maximum volume reductions in these years were about 325, 643, and 1025 m(3) d(-1). These volume reductions reflect a landfill life extension of a minimum of half a year and a maximum of about four years. Compost product could be produced at a minimum of 14, 30, and 54 tons d(-1) in 2003, 2012, and 2020, respectively, and at a maximum in those years of about 80, 158, and 252 tons d-(1.) At the same time benefit is gained in compost product, GHG emissions could be reduced by a minimum of 12.8% and a maximum of 65.0% from 2003 to 2020.

106,"Urban areas are recognised to be significant global energy consumers, and therefore high CO2 emitters, making energy management at urban scales a relevant research focus. However, one of the main obstacles faced with upgrading existing urban systems to meet target energy reductions is the current rate of refurbishment and new build, where it is estimated that 75% of existing buildings will still be in place by 2050. Moreover limited renewable resources and predicted warming trends place further limitations on policies aimed at carbon management. This paper examines current thinking around energy management associated with building operational and regulated loads and the role of urban form. Its focus is on cooling loads for office buildings in central London and offers a new perspective on energy management at an urban scale by demonstrating (within the 25% redevelopment rate) that when building energy management is considered within an urban context, the overall performance of an urban system can be significantly improved. The work highlights the often overlooked role of urban form on building energy performance (both individually and in combination) and demonstrates that as we move towards a low energy future; the role of urban form becomes increasing significant.

The paper aims at an exante evaluation of the market trends revealed by EPCs in Greece, in order to identify the perspectives of individual technologies and to assess the degree to which the certification procedure helps in improving the energy performance of buildings.

The European Commission empower the importance of achieving the objective of the recast Directive on energy performance of buildings (EPBD) that new buildings built from 2021 onwards will have to be nearly zero-energy buildings. The general belief is that the energy performance optimization of buildings requires an integrated design approach and cross-disciplinary teamwork to optimize the building's energy use and quality of indoor environment while satisfying the occupants' needs.In this context, there is a substantial need for professionals such as architects and engineers specifically trained and educated in integrated design approach and trained to work in cross-disciplinary teams. To be able to push forward the development, it is essential that educational institutions foster professionals with such knowledge, skills and competences. An initiative toward this direction is the EU-project of IDES-EDU: ""Master and Post-Graduate education and training in multi-disciplinary teams"".The paper describes the necessity of more integrated and cross-disciplinary approaches to building design through state-of-the-art of the building sector and educational initiatives in the participating countries in the project, and through theory of design processes.

112,"As government and industry plan to reduce energy consumption in building stock, there is a need to forecast the uptake of retrofit packages across building stock over time. To address this challenge a diffusion model was set up and applied to office building stock across New South Wales (NSW) in Australia, accommodating a high spatial resolution and temporal capability for projecting uptake of technology packages characterised by multiple variables. Six retrofit packages were set up for the diffusion model, which ranged from inexpensive services and manuals through to mid-priced packages involving energy efficient T5 lighting and solar hot water through to expensive packages such as chilled beams and Solar PV. We evaluated the model using a base case and two policy programs, representing the Green Building Fund and Environmental Upgrade Agreements. These were recent incentive programs funded by the Australian government to accelerate the uptake of retrofit packages, by providing financial support to upfront expenditures and removing barriers to retrofit.

113,"The Spanish economy faces two key issues. The first of these is the significant reliance on non-renewable energy, which reached 76.4% and was 22 points over the European Union average. Secondly, the threat that the fee deficit poses to the sustainability of the National Grid. This fact is forcing the Spanish Government to implement measures focused on tax increases. However, these decisions have done little to contain the situation. This paper proposes the use of sustainable transport models based on electric mobility: smart grids, buses, taxis and electric vehicles, in the city of Leon, Spain (135,059 inhabitants) as an important means for controlling and reducing the fee deficit. Through exhaustive analysis of EV (electric vehicle) market penetration against current Government forecasts, a rigorous profitability study has been conducted for the period 2020-2030 (when smart grids will be ready). By introducing policy modifications, the Net Actual Value internal rate of return and payback figures justify its implementation. Thus, the fee deficit of Leon could be reduced by up to 43%. Finally, an analysis of macroeconomic impacts, such as competitive improvements in the economy, and environmental impact is conducted. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

114,"A total of 1,000 kilns producing 3.5 billion bricks and consuming 0.85 million tons of coal per year resulted in an estimated 2,200 to 4,000 premature deaths and 0.2 to 0.5 million asthma attacks per year in the Greater Dhaka region. In this paper, the emission reductions and health cost savings are presented for moving to cleaner brick manufacturing technologies for the districts of Gazipur, Savar, Dhamrai, Rupganj, Manikganj, Kaliganj, and Narayanganj. A summary of various technologies and feasibility of these technologies based on lessons learnt from the pilots is discussed. We explored three ""what-if"" scenarios through 2020 for better energy efficiency, lower coal consumption, and lower emission rates, under which the total health cost savings are estimated to range between USD12 million annually for short-term implementation and up to 55 million annually for long-term implementation. Between 2015 and 2020, the cumulative health cost savings could range between USD126 and 234 million, which clearly outweigh any cost of capital investment necessary for the technology change. An improvement in energy efficiency will result in USD1.8 to 3.0 million per year in coal savings, which will accrue to the kiln owners collectively, and these savings will pay back the capital investment within 3-4 years, in addition to the health cost savings for the city inhabitants. Hence, the entrepreneurs have all the social, environmental, and economic incentives to adopt cleaner technologies. A major gap at the regulatory level is in building awareness for the entrepreneurs and setting up an incentive structure to implement this transition, which is being addressed by an advisory committee by the Government of Bangladesh responsible for the revision of the Brick Burning Act of 1989 and related legislations.",WOS:000332712300009,2020,"{emiss, carbon, ghg}",383
115,"Technological change has often been presented as a readily accepted means by which long-term greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions can be achieved. Cities are the future centers of economic growth, with the global population becoming predominantly urban; hence, increases or reductions of GHG emissions are tied to their energy strategies. This research examines the likelihood of a developed world city (the Greater Toronto Area) achieving an 80% reduction in GHG emissions through policy-enabled technological change.Emissions are examined from 3 major sources: light duty passenger vehicles, residential buildings and commercial/institutional buildings. Logistic diffusion curves are applied for the adoption of alternative vehicle technologies, building retrofits and high performance new building construction. This research devises high, low and business-as-usual estimates of future technological adoption and finds that even aggressive scenarios are not sufficient to achieve an 80% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050. This further highlights the challenges faced in maintaining a relatively stable climate. Urban policy makers must consider that the longer the lag before this transition occurs, the greater the share of GHG emissions mitigation that must addressed through behavioural change in order to meet the 2050 target, which likely poses greater political challenges.

116,"Estimations of biogas emissions in final disposal sites have been studied by several researchers, primarily for their potential as a renewable source of energy and greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. Different models have been developed to predict the generation of biogas; the first-order model is widely used. Most of these models are based on two parameters, the methane generation rate (k) and methane generation potential (L-0). These parameters cannot be generalized for biogas estimation in any site, and must be modified according to in situ characteristics. The objectives of this research are (a) modify the constants of k and L-0 with in situ data, and (b) estimate the biogas generation in a sanitary landfill of a Mexican city using the modified constants. The following data were used in modifying the model constants biogas: (a) waste characterization studies, (b) biogas extraction tests, (c) observations of characteristics and sanitary landfill operation, (d) interviews with the managers of the sanitary landfill, and (e) several parameters of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) model. Biogas estimation using the modified constants was performed in the version 2.0 Mexico Landfill Gas Model proposed by Stearns, Conrad and Schmidt Consulting Engineers, Inc. (SCS Engineers). The results show that approximately 70% of the waste generated is organic, which influences the value of the parameters used in calculating the k and L-0. With in situ characteristics, values of k = 0.0482 yr(-1) and L-0 = 94,457 m(3)/t were obtained. It is projected that the electric power generation could reach a maximum capacity of 2.4 MW in 2019. This energy could increase the installed capacity in the Ensenada by approximately 4.36% and supply approximately 66% of the electric energy required for lighting, which amounts to savings of US$2.62 million and an environmental benefit of approximately 1.17 Mt CO(2)e from 2009 to 2025.

The study also investigates the effects of tourist flows on town's energy consumption by modelling energy scenarios for permanent and summer homes. Two long-term energy scenarios (to 2030) were modelled using the MarIcAL-TIMES generator model: BAU (business as usual), which is the reference scenario, and EHS (exemplary household sector), which involves targets of penetration for renewables and micro-cogeneration. The analysis demonstrated the critical role of end-use energy efficiency in curbing residential consumption. Cogeneration and renewables (PV (photovoltaic) and solar thermal panels) were proven to be valuable solutions to reduce the energetic and environmental burden of the household sector (-20% in 2030). Because most of household energy demand is ascribable to space-heating or hot water production, this study finds that micro-CHP technologies with lower power-to-heat ratios (mainly, Stirling engines and microturbines) show a higher diffusion, as do solar thermal devices.

119,"This paper presents the historical development and background of life cycle assessment (LCA) and nearly zero-energy buildings in Germany. In order to plan and build responsibly for the future, it is necessary to have an overview of the topic at hand. Final energy demand during the operational phase of buildings has fallen steadily. According to European Union guidelines (2010/31/EU), starting in 2021 new buildings must achieve the nearly zero-energy standards. These buildings will have very low operational energy demand. As a consequence of this requirement, the relative impact of construction and disposal increases in terms of the entire life cycle. This is also the case currently for buildings with low operational energy demand. The research - based on a literature analysis and review - shows that LCA has existed since the 1970s as a tool to judge potential environmental impacts. Moreover, the energy building standards in Germany have developed continuously since 1977. This process will continue in the new German Energy Saving Ordinance in 2014, which will be tightened even further in 2016. As LCA is well established and sustainable buildings are becoming increasingly common, the next indispensable step is to consider the life cycle view of nearly zero-energy buildings.

120,"Anaerobic digestion is a well known process that (while still capable of showing new features) has experienced several waves of technological development. It was ""born"" as a wastewater treatment system, in the 1970s showed promise as an alternative energy source (in particular from animal waste), in the 1980s and later it became a standard for treating organic-matter-rich industrial wastewater, and more recently returned to the market for its energy recovery potential, making use of different biomasses, including energy crops. With the growing concern around global warming, this paper looks at the potential of anaerobic digestion in terms of reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.The potential contribution of anaerobic digestion to GHG reduction has been computed for the 27 EU countries on the basis of their 2005 Kyoto declarations and using life cycle data. The theoretical potential contribution of anaerobic digestion to Kyoto and EU post- Kyoto targets has been calculated. Two different possible biogas applications have been considered: electricity production from manure waste, and upgraded methane production for light goods vehicles (from landfill biogas and municipal and industrial wastewater treatment sludges). The useful heat that can be produced as by-product from biogas conversion into electricity has not been taken into consideration, as its real exploitation depends on local conditions. Moreover the amount of biogas already produced via dedicated anaerobic digestion processes has also not been included in the calculations. Therefore the overall gains achievable would be even higher than those reported here.This exercise shows that biogas may considerably contribute to GHG emission reductions in particular if used as a biofuel. Results also show that its use as a biofuel may allow for true negative GHG emissions, showing a net advantage with respect to other biofuels. Considering also energy crops that will become available in the next few years as a result of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, this study shows that biogas has the potential of covering almost 50% of the 2020 biofuel target of 10% of all automotive transport fuels, without implying a change in land use. Moreover, considering the achievable GHG reductions, a very large carbon emission trading ""value"" could support the investment needs.However, those results were obtained through a ""qualitative"" assessment. In order to produce robust data for decision makers, a quantitative sustainability assessment should be carried out, integrating different methodologies within a life cycle framework. The identification of the most appropriate policy for promoting the best set of options is then discussed.",WOS:000256799000001,2020,"{treatment, wastewat, plant}",270

122,"The Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme (LATS) is one of the main instruments used in England to enforce the landfill diversion targets established in the Directive 1999/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 April 1999 on the landfill of waste (Landfill Directive). Through the LATS, biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) allowances for landfilling are allocated to each local authority, otherwise known as waste disposal authorities (WDAs). The quantity of landfill allowances received is expected to decrease continuously from 2005/06 to 2019/20 so as to meet the objectives of the Landfill Directive. To achieve their commitments, WDAs can exchange, buy, sell or transfer allowances among each other, or may reprofile their own allocation through banking and/or borrowing. Despite the goals for the first seven years - which included two target years (2005/06 and 2009/10) - being widely achieved (the average allocation of allowances per WDA was 22.9% higher than those finally used), market activity among WDAs was high and prices were not very stable. Results in terms of waste reduction and recycling levels have been satisfactory. The reduction of BMW landfilled (in percentage) was higher during the first seven years of the LATS period (2005/06-2011/12) (around 7% annually) than during the previous period (2001/02-2004/05) (4.2% annually). Since 2008, the significance of the LATS diminished because of an increase in the rate of the UK Landfill Tax. The LATS was suppressed after the 2012/13 target year, before what it was initially scheduled. The purpose of this paper is to describe the particularities of the LATS, analyse its performance as a waste management policy, make a comparison with the Landfill Tax, discuss its main features as regards efficiency, effectiveness and the application of the ""polluter pays"" principle and finally discuss if the effect of the increase in the Landfill Tax is what made the LATS ultimately unnecessary.

125,"This research develops then merges two separate models to simulate electric vehicle diffusion through recreation of the Boston metropolitan statistical area vehicle market place. The first model is a mixed (random parameters) logistic regression applied to data from the US Department of Transportation's 2009 National Household Travel Survey. The second, agent-based model simulates social network interactions through which agents' vehicle choice sets are endogenously determined. Parameters from the first model are applied to the choice sets determined in the second. Results indicate that electric vehicles as a percentages of vehicle stock range from 1% to 22% in the Boston metropolitan statistical area in the year 2030, percentages being highly dependent on scenario specifications. A lower price is the main source of competitive advantage for vehicles but other characteristics, such as vehicle classification and range, are demonstrated to influence consumer choice. Government financial incentive availability leads to greater market shares in the beginning years and helps to spread diffusion in later years due to an increased base of initial adopters. Although seen as a potential hindrance to EV diffusion, battery cost scenarios have relatively small impacts on EV diffusion in comparison to policy, range, miles per gallon (MPG), and vehicle miles travelled (VMT) as a percentage of range assumptions. Pessimistic range assumptions decrease overall PHEV and BEV percentages of vehicle stock by 50% and 30%, respectively, relative to the EPA-estimated range scenarios. Fuel cost scenarios do not considerably alter estimated BEV and PHEV stock but increase the ratio of car stock to light truck stock in the internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle spectrum. Specifically, cars are estimated at 55% of ICE vehicle stock in the default fuel price scenario but increase to 62% of ICE vehicle stock in the high world oil price scenario, with LTs covering the appropriate differences.",WOS:000318544900005,2030,"{vehicl, electr, charg}",269

This study uses the bottom-up LBNL China End-Use Energy Model to assess the role of energy efficiency policies in transitioning China to a lower emission trajectory and meeting its 2020 intensity reduction goals. Two scenarios - Continued Improvement and Accelerated Improvement - were developed to assess the impact of actions already taken by the Chinese government as well as planned and potential actions, and to evaluate the potential for China to reduce energy demand and emissions. This scenario analysis presents an important modeling approach based in the diffusion of end-use technologies and physical drivers of energy demand and thereby help illuminate China's complex and dynamic drivers of energy consumption and implications of energy efficiency policies. The findings suggest that China's CO2 emissions will not likely continue growing throughout this century because of saturation effects in appliances, residential and commercial floor area, roadways, fertilizer use; and population peak around 2030 with slowing urban population growth.

Further improvements to having similar standards as developed countries such as England and Wales will have less significance and cannot nullify the effects of climate change from the newly retrofitted public buildings.

Street widths and building heights were adjusted to maximize the potential for passive solar heating and daylight use within buildings. The district's environmental performance, analyzed using building energy evaluation and traffic micro simulation models, showed that the design would reduce energy loads by over 25% compared to business as usual.

More than half of the world's population lives in, and more than half of the world's economic output comes from, cities. Up to 70% of global carbon emissions can also be attributed to consumption that takes place in cities. Recent research has shown that cost-effective investments in low-carbon options could deliver a 40% reduction in GHG emissions from cities by 2020, while also providing wider economic benefits such as enhanced competitiveness and increased employment. As yet, however, investments in low-carbon cities have not been made at scale due mainly to the scale of the finance required, local government budgetary constraints, and perceptions about their costs and benefits. With a focus on the UK, a contemporary account is provided of what local authorities see as the major financial risks associated with funding low-carbon cities. Practical proposals - which also have more general relevance to the future financing of low-carbon cities around the world - are offered on how local authorities, in conjunction with central government, the private sector, and institutional investors, can effectively manage these risks.Policy relevanceCities house more than half of the world's population, generate more than half of the world's economic output, and produce between 40% and 70% of all anthropogenic GHG emissions.

There are several obstacles and related risks to this transition, including financial and legal obstacles and the differing views and perceptions of stakeholders. These can be attenuated, somewhat, by national government support at scale, local authority leadership, and cooperation between other authorities and the private sector, and the development of tools and guidance to reduce transaction costs.",WOS:000320752000006,2020,"{develop, sustain, plan}",898
132,"Residential buildings account for about one-third of the final energy demand in Norway. Many cost-effective measures for reducing heat losses in buildings are known, and their implementation may make the building sector one of the largest contributors to climate change mitigation. To determine the sectoral emission reduction potential, we model a complete transformation of the dwelling stock by 2050 by applying both renovation and reconstruction with different energy standards. We propose a new dynamic stock model with an optimization routine to identify and prioritize buildings with the highest energy saving potential. We combine material flow analysis (MFA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques to extend the sectoral boundary beyond direct household emissions. Despite an expected population growth of almost 50% between 2000 and 2050, sectoral carbon emissions in that period may drop between 30% and 40% for scenarios where the stock is completely transformed by either reconstruction or renovation to the passive house standard. Due to its lower upstream impact, renovation leads to a lower sectoral carbon footprint than reconstruction. Full transformation, however, is not sufficient to achieve an emissions reduction of 50% or more, as required on average to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, because hot water generation, appliances, and lighting will dominate the sectoral footprint once the stock has been transformed. A first estimate of the additional impact of realistic energy efficiency and lifestyle changes in the nonheating part of the sector reveals a maximal total reduction potential of about 75%.",WOS:000322719300007,2050,"{emiss, carbon, ghg}",383

The three strategies show the potential of drawing the transport demand to the more energy efficient vehicles; however, more initiatives are needed if the sustainable transport is the long term objective, such as the solutions to stabilise the private vehicle demands, to continuously improve the vehicle efficiency and to boost the alternative fuels produced from the renewable energy sources.

135,"US cities are beginning to experiment with a regulatory approach to address information failures in the real estate market by mandating the energy benchmarking of commercial buildings. Understanding how a commercial building uses energy has many benefits; for example, it helps building owners and tenants identify poor-performing buildings and subsystems and it enables high-performing buildings to achieve greater occupancy rates, rents, and property values. This paper estimates the possible impacts of a national energy benchmarking mandate through analysis chiefly utilizing the Georgia Tech version of the National Energy Modeling System (GT-NEMS). Correcting input discount rates results in a 4.0% reduction in projected energy consumption for seven major classes of equipment relative to the reference case forecast in 2020, rising to 8.7% in 2035. Thus, the official US energy forecasts appear to overestimate future energy consumption by underestimating investments in energy-efficient equipment. Further discount rate reductions spurred by benchmarking policies yield another 1.3-1.4% in energy savings in 2020, increasing to 2.2-2.4% in 2035. Benchmarking would increase the purchase of energy-efficient equipment, reducing energy bills, CO2 emissions, and conventional air pollution. Achieving comparable CO2 savings would require more than tripling existing US solar capacity. Our analysis suggests that nearly 90% of the energy saved by a national benchmarking policy would benefit metropolitan areas, and the policy's benefits would outweigh its costs, both to the private sector and society broadly.",WOS:000325247100063,2020,"{energi, build, consumpt}",779

The paper gives an overview of the first outcomes of the analysis of the status quo and assessment of the most likely developments regarding GHG emissions, climate impacts and resource use in Wuxi-the Chinese pilot city for the LCFC project. As a first step, a detailed emission inventory following the IPCC guidelines for Wuxi has been carried out. In a second step, the future development of energy demand and related CO2 emissions in 2050 were simulated in a current policy scenario (CPS). In parallel, selected aspects of material and water flows for the energy and the building sector were analyzed and modeled. In addition, recent and future climate impacts and vulnerability were investigated. Based on these findings, nine key sectors with high relevance to the three dimensions could be identified.

144,"Transportation sectors in developing countries suffer from some diseases that one of them is ever-increasing energy consumption. Integrated National Energy Planning (INEP) in transportation sector is a solution for these countries to alter their suboptimal pattern and rationalize their energy consumption. One of the INEP targets is determining optimal patterns of fuels and transportation technologies to satisfy future demand of freight and passenger transportation at the lowest cost levels. Following the above target, this paper is concerned with the optimal consumption pattern of fuels focusing on vehicle technologies within the next 25 years (up to 2029). Using Energy Flow Optimization Model-ENVironment (EFOM-ENV) model, various steps as designing of ""Reference Energy System (RES)"" of the model, data processing and scenario analysis are followed. Based on the modeling results, substitution of urban railroad technologies (subway, LRT and monorail), all of passenger CNG technologies (cars, buses and minibuses), rural railroad freight technologies (electrical, gas oil and LNG freight trains) and finally, CNG and LNG heavy and light trucks with current passenger and freight vehicle technologies are suggested. This scenario will decline fuel consumption by about 14% totally, that the most part of it belongs to gasoline and gas oil (24% and 17%, respectively).

Existing approaches to housing retrofit focus on regulations, financial incentives and information provision, but it is argued these are insufficient to realize large-scale, deep changes in energy consumption. An agenda is proposed for systemic domestic retrofit to realize radical changes in the housing stock through community-based partnerships. These programmes are based on a social practices approach that promotes social innovation.

148,"Identifying strategies for reconciling human development and climate change mitigation requires an adequate understanding of how infrastructures contribute to well-being and greenhouse gas emissions. While direct emissions from infrastructure use are well-known, information about indirect emissions from their construction is highly fragmented. Here, we estimated the carbon footprint of the existing global infrastructure stock in 2008, assuming current technologies, to be 122 (-20/+15) Gt CO2. The average per-capita carbon footprint of infrastructures in industrialized countries (53 (+/- 6) t CO2) was approximately 5 times larger that that of developing countries (10 (+/- 1) t CO2). A globalization of Western infrastructure stocks using current technologies would cause approximately 350 Gt CO2 from materials production, which corresponds to about 35-60% of the remaining carbon budget available until 2050 if the average temperature increase is to be limited to 2 degrees C, and could thus compromise the 2 degrees C target. A promising but poorly explored mitigation option is to build new settlements using less emissions-intensive materials, for example by urban design; however, this strategy is constrained by a lack of bottom-up data on material stocks in infrastructures.

149,"There is universal agreement between the United Nations and governments from the richest to the poorest nations that humanity faces unprecedented global challenges relating to sustainable energy, clean water, low-emission transportation, coping with climate change and natural disasters, and reclaiming use of land. We have invited researchers from a range of eclectic research areas to provide a Roadmap of how superconducting technologies could address these major challenges confronting humanity.Superconductivity has, over the century since its discovery by Kamerlingh Onnes in 1911, promised to provide solutions to many challenges. So far, most superconducting technologies are esoteric systems that are used in laboratories and hospitals. Large science projects have long appreciated the ability of superconductivity to efficiently create high magnetic fields that are otherwise very costly to achieve with ordinary materials. The most successful applications outside of large science are high-field magnets for magnetic resonance imaging, laboratory magnetometers for mineral and materials characterization, filters for mobile communications, and magnetoencephalography for understanding the human brain.The stage is now set for superconductivity to make more general contributions. Humanity uses practically unthinkable amounts of energy to drive our modern way of life. Overall, global power usage has been predicted to almost double from 16.5 to 30 TW in the next four decades (2011 Equinox Summit: Energy 2030 http://wgsi.org/publications-resources).The economy with which electrons carry energy compels the continued quest for efficient superconducting power generation, energy storage, and power transmission. The growing global population requires new arable land and treatment of water, especially in remote areas, and superconductivity offers unique solutions to these problems. Exquisite detectors give warning of changes that are otherwise invisible. Prediction of climate and disasters will be helped by future supercomputer technologies that support huge amounts of data and sophisticated modeling, and with the aid of superconductivity these systems might not require the energy of a large city.We present different sections on applications that could address (or are addressing) a range of environmental issues. The Roadmap covers water purification, power distribution and storage, low-environmental impact transport, environmental sensing (particularly for the removal of unexploded munitions), monitoring the Earth's magnetic fields for earthquakes and major solar activity, and, finally, developing a petaflop supercomputer that only requires 3% of the current supercomputer power provision while being 50 times faster.Access to fresh water. With only 2.5% of the water on Earth being fresh and climate change modeling forecasting that many areas will become drier, the ability to recycle water and achieve compact water recycling systems for sewage or ground water treatment is critical. The first section (by Nishijima) points to the potential of superconducting magnetic separation to enable water recycling and reuse.Energy. The Equinox Summit held in Waterloo Canada 2011 (2011 Equinox Summit: Energy 2030 http://wgsi.org/publications-resources) identified electricity use as humanity's largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Our appetite for electricity is growing faster than for any other form of energy. The communique from the summit said 'Transforming the ways we generate, distribute and store electricity is among the most pressing challenges facing society today .... If we want to stabilize CO2 levels in our atmosphere at 550 parts per million, all of that growth needs to be met by non-carbon forms of energy' (2011 Equinox Summit: Energy 2030 http://wgsi.org/publications-resources). Superconducting technologies can provide the energy efficiencies to achieve, in the European Union alone, 33-65% of the required reduction in greenhouse gas emissions according to the Kyoto Protocol (Hartikainen et al 2003 Supercond. Sci. Technol. 16 963). New technologies would include superconducting energy storage systems to effectively store power generation from renewable sources as well as high-temperature superconducting systems used in generators, transformers and synchronous motors in power stations and heavy-industry facilities. However, to be effective, these systems must be superior to conventional systems and, in reality, market penetration will occur as existing electrical machinery is written off. At current write-off rates, to achieve a 50% transfer to superconducting systems will take 20 years (Hartikainen et al 2003 Supercond. Sci. Technol. 16 963).The Roadmap next considers dc transmission of green power with a section by Eckroad and Marian who provide an update on the development of superconducting power transmission lines in view of recent sustainability studies. The potential of magnetic energy storage is then presented by Coi and Kim, who argue that a successful transition to wind and solar power generation must be harmonized with the conventional electrical network, which requires a storage technology with a fast response and long backup times.Transport. Superconducting Maglev trains and motors for international shipping have the potential to considerably reduce the emissions that contribute to greenhouse gases while improving their economic viability by reducing losses and improving efficiencies.International shipping, alone, contributes 3% of the greenhouse gas emissions. Three sections of the Roadmap identify how high-speed rail can be a major solution to providing fast, low energy, environmentally-friendly transport enabling reduction in automobile and aircraft travel by offering an alternative that is very competitive. With maritime international environmental regulations tightening, HTS motors with the characteristics of high torque and compactness will become important devices for high-performance and low-emission electric ship propulsion systems. A section on the development of a megawatt-class superconducting motor for ship propulsion is presented by Umemoto.Monitoring in manufacturing for waste reduction. Environmental impact from the waste created by the manufacturing sector and the need to make manufacturing efficient can be addressed by terahertz imaging. This technology has great potential in non-destructive testing, industrial process monitoring and control to greatly improve the industry process efficiency and reliability by reducing waste materials and toxic by-products. The section by Du shows how terahertz imaging can provide process and property information such as rust levels under paint that can assist with the reduction of waste in manufacturing and maintenance.Monitoring for naturally occurring disturbances. The environmental and social impact of natural disasters is mounting. Febvre provides the Roadmap for the use of ultra-sensitive magnetometry to understand geomagnetic phenomena and Earth-ionosphere couplings through the study of very small variations of the magnetic field. This magnetic monitoring has many implications for understanding our environment and providing new tools for early warning of natural hazards, either on Earth or in space which will enable us to be better prepared for natural disasters.Restoring environments after military use. Throughout the world, there are many areas confirmed or suspected of being contaminated by unexploded munitions known as unexploded ordnance (UXO). Its presence is the result of wars and training of military forces. Areas affected by UXO contamination are hazardous to the public and have a major influence on the nature of land use. UXO has impact in developed as well as developing nations. For example, the USA has UXO dating back to the American Civil War and countries such as Cambodia are living with landmines as a daily issue due to more recent wars. Underwater UXO has caused severe impacts such as the explosion in 1969 in the waters of Kent in the UK that caused a reading of 4.5 on the Richter scale for earthquake monitors. Another example was a land-based detonation of a 500 kg World War II bomb in Germany killing three people in 2010. There is countless UXO from recent conflicts worldwide. Detection and accurate location with 100% reliability is required to return land to safe civilian use. Keenan provides details of a prototype magnetic gradiometer developed for this purpose.Reducing power needs for high-end IT. Supercomputers are so large that they are close to requiring their own small power plant to support the energy needed to run the computer. For example, in 2011 Facebook data centers and operations used 532 million kW hours of energy. Mukhanov explores the potential of reducing the power dissipation for future supercomputers from more than 500 MW for Exascale systems to 0.2 MW by using superconducting-ferromagnetic Josephson junctions for magnetic memory and programmable logic.Clearly superconductivity is an ultimate energy-saving technology, and its practical implementation will contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions, improved water purification, reduction of waste and timely preparedness for natural disasters or significant events. This Roadmap shows how the application of superconducting technologies will have a significant impact when they are adopted.",WOS:000325989100003,2030,"{water, heat, suppli}",145
150,"Owners and municipalities face the choice to renovate or rebuild buildings in order to improve energy efficiency and sustainability. The process of upgrading the existing building stock can be supported by land management tools, i.e., municipal energy plans (MEP) or sustainable building codes (BC), that municipalities use to plan, check and monitor actions taken. Many local and regional authorities are involved in the Covenant of Mayors supported by the European Union (EU): the sustainable energy action plan (SEAP) is the key document in which the Covenant signatory outlines how it intends to reach CO2 reduction target by 2020. Sustainability at the urban scale is also supported by voluntary certification schemes such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)(R) for neighbourhood development proposed by the United States Green Building Council (USGBC), Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) Communities proposed by UK Building Research Establishment (BRE) and Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency (CASBEE) for Urban Development proposed by the Japan GreenBuild Council. The fact that there are so many tools to manage urban sustainability is positive, but what happens when multiple tools are applied to the same territory?

151,"We employ a single-country dynamically-recursive Computable General Equilibrium model to make health-focussed macroeconomic assessments of three contingent UK Greenhouse Gas (GHG) mitigation strategies, designed to achieve 2030 emission targets as suggested by the UK Committee on Climate Change. In contrast to previous assessment studies, our main focus is on health co-benefits additional to those from reduced local air pollution. We employ a conservative cost-effectiveness methodology with a zero net cost threshold. Our urban transport strategy (with cleaner vehicles and increased active travel) brings important health co-benefits and is likely to be strongly cost-effective; our food and agriculture strategy (based on abatement technologies and reduction in livestock production) brings worthwhile health co-benefits, but is unlikely to eliminate net costs unless new technological measures are included; our household energy efficiency strategy is likely to breakeven only over the long term after the investment programme has ceased (beyond our 20 year time horizon). We conclude that UK policy makers will, most likely, have to adopt elements which involve initial net societal costs in order to achieve future emission targets and longer-term benefits from GHG reduction. Cost-effectiveness of GHG strategies is likely to require technological mitigation interventions and/or demand-constraining interventions with important health co-benefits and other efficiency-enhancing policies that promote internalization of externalities. Health co-benefits can play a crucial role in bringing down net costs, but our results also suggest the need for adopting holistic assessment methodologies which give proper consideration to welfare-improving health co-benefits with potentially negative economic repercussions (such as increased longevity).",WOS:000326944000010,2030,"{emiss, carbon, ghg}",383
152,"Urban population growth is leading to growing concerns about land use change, green infrastructure, and the loss of beneficial ecosystem services. Human and environmental health is supported by services such as climate regulation, air filtration, and flood mitigation. However, maintaining these services within cities requires the preservation and equitable distribution of green infrastructure near where people live. Sydney, Australia, where the population is expected to grow from 4.3 million to 5.6 million by 2031, is undergoing an urban transformation. This study investigates the spatial distribution of green infrastructure within Sydney to determine how patterns of green infrastructure vary according to land use, residential density, and socio-economic variation. More than half of urban Sydney is comprised of residential land use, representing the single largest contribution to Sydney's green infrastructure. Two types of green infrastructure are examined in this study, public green space represented by parkland area and tree canopy cover and private green space represented by residential area and tree canopy cover. Results show that with greater dwelling density, both types of green infrastructure decrease. Availability of private versus public green infrastructure, however, differs according to socio-economic advantage. Suburbs of higher socio-economic advantage have significantly more private green cover, but slightly less public green cover than suburbs of greater disadvantage. These findings highlight that urban densification can lead to a general loss of two important reservoirs of urban green infrastructure (public parkland and residential tree cover). Disadvantaged communities may have a greater reliance on public green infrastructure in the form of parkland due to a lack of private residential tree cover. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

153,"Cities are developing greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation plans and reduction targets on the basis of a growing body of knowledge about climate change risks, and changes to passenger transportation are often at the center of these efforts. Yet little information exists for characterizing how quickly or slowly GHG emissions reductions will accrue given changes in urban form around transit and whether benefits will accrue quickly enough to meet policy year targets (such as reaching 20% of 1990 GHG emissions levels by 2050). Achieving GHG reductions through integrated transportation and land use planning is even more complicated for cities because changes in emissions can occur across many sectors (such as transportation, building energy use, and electricity generation). With the use of the Los Angeles, California, Expo Line, a framework was developed to assess how financing schemes could affect the rate of building redevelopment and resulting life-cycle GHG emissions from travel and building energy use. The framework leveraged an integrated transportation and land use life-cycle assessment model that captured upfront construction of new development near transit and the long-term changes in household energy use for travel and buildings. The results show that for the same amount of development around the Expo Line, it is possible either to meet state GHG goals by 2050 (if aggressive redevelopment happens early) or not meet those goals by 2050 (if significant redevelopment does not start for decades). The time-based approach reveals how redevelopment schedules should be considered when strategies for meeting future GHG emissions targets are set.",WOS:000364618200008,2050,"{emiss, carbon, ghg}",383
154,"For a 40-year horizon (1990-2030), on-road vehicle exhaust emissions were evaluated, retrospectively and prospectively, for the largest urban agglomeration in India - the Greater Delhi region with a combined population of 22 million in 2011 (Delhi along with Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida, Faridabad and Gurgaon). Emissions of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) reached their peak during late 1990s through early 2000s after which they reduced significantly through year 2012. On the other hand, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon dioxide show an increasing trend. The most reduction in emissions between 1998 and 2012 occurred as a result of implementation of four sets of vehicular emission standards, removal of lead, reduction of sulfur content, mandatory retirement of older commercial vehicles, and conversion of diesel and petrol run public transport vehicles to compressed natural gas. In addition, changes in the vehicular technology have also contributed to controlling emissions especially in case of auto-rickshaws and motorized two-wheelers, which changed from two-stroke to four-stroke. The rising trend of NOx along with the presence of VOCs indicates increasing tendency to form ground-level ozone and as a result, smog in the region. We predict that the current regime of vehicle technology, fuel standards, and high growth rate of private vehicles, is likely to nullify all the past emission reductions by the end of 2020s.

155,"The building stock is one of the most important energy consumers worldwide. Therefore, a number of energy reduction targets and regulations exist for the construction sector. Different building stock models have been developed in order to investigate the potentials of energy-efficiency and changes in energy source in the building stock. However, these models often have important shortcomings, since they are single-issued and do not include the life cycle of buildings. Thus, we propose an innovative assessment methodology in the form of a life cycle-based building stock model (LC-Build). The building stock is clustered in building cohorts of similar construction and equipment characteristics in terms of type, construction period and building technology systems. The most important building components are assigned specific thermal transmittance values. Figures for diffusion and retrofit rate describe the development of the building stock fabric. Additionally, environmental impact from the energy supply side is taken into account. This approach facilitates the evaluation of the effectiveness of measures and their dynamics on the building stock, such as newer and more efficient technologies and practices related to energy policies and prices. Furthermore, the model has a direct relationship to the construction activity (energy-efficiency measures, substitution of fossil energy based heating systems) and fosters the comprehension of material flows, related environmental impact, and costs. The practicality of this approach is demonstrated by means of a case study in the city of Zurich in Switzerland. The results suggest that Zurich has a remarkable potential to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector: 85% by 2050. The case study highlights the advantages of the proposed modeling approach. The LC-Build is a valuable tool to identify and test sustainable energy targets for building stocks, such as the European 20-20-20 target. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

156,"Directive 2010/31/EU adopted that by the end of 2020 all new buildings should be nearly Zero-Energy Buildings (nZEB) and Member States should achieve cost-optimal levels by ensuring minimum energy performance requirements for buildings. This paper discusses how low should be the energy required by a nZEB, in the context of housing energy consumption in a Mediterranean climate (Lisbon). For selected houses built after 1990, the calculated primary energy loads for regulated uses - heating, cooling and domestic hot water - are found to be below 90 kWh/(m(2) year). Applying the cost-optimal solutions of thermal insulation and glazing type and considering energy efficiency improved systems, this study concludes that housing energy loads are 'low' for the indicative range of 70 kWh/(m(2) year) for regulated uses or 100-110 kWh/(m(2) year) for total uses, taking primary energy indicators (PEI) from EN 15603. Assuming PEI from Passive House Planning Package or those to be assumed in Portugal for 2013, the threshold decreases to 60 kWh/(m(2) year) for regulated uses or 90-100 kWh/(m(2) year) for total uses. Only the first nZEB condition is explored by this paper. The second condition requires that the nZEB energy load is covered by a 'significant' part of renewable energy sources produced on-site or 'nearby'. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This methodology enables policy analysts to (1) quantify how different urban development strategies and patterns would affect about CO2 emissions; (2) directly link behavioral changes with urban development patterns and policies; and (3) analyze and understand the sensitivities of the urban passenger transportation sector in responding to both national- and city-level policies for carbon mitigation, thus helping the policy evaluation and development.Detailed information regarding urban passenger travels are collected in grouped Chinese cities of six categories. With the newly developed methodology, total carbon emissions from China's urban passenger transportation sector under three scenarios are considered. The results showed that mode choice changes are the most sensitive to policies.

Average commute time rises by 7.7 percent with each cross-sectional doubling of Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) jobs. Using the RELU-TRAN structural computable general equilibrium model of the Chicago MSA, we simulate the equilibrium effects of a 24 percent population increase projected from 2000 to 2030 by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning. If no new road capacity is added, then congestion per mile increases. Although the urbanized land area increases by 19 percent, indicating sprawl, the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per car-trip decreases by 1.31 percent and the VMT per car-trip to work decreases by 2.78 percent.

165,"This paper investigates the risk of projected post-2050s overheating in existing, retrofitted and new-build dwellings in the United Kingdom. As shown in the previous research, passive measures may not be sufficient in mitigating overheating risk. Therefore, mechanical cooling technologies that may be deployed to adapt' to a warming climate are tested for energy and CO2 implications. For retrofits, heating demand is projected to remain dominant, whereas in post-2016 new-build, greater cooling system efficiency will be important. Thermal mass is shown to reduce future cooling load. The heat recovery element of mechanical ventilation with heat recovery may be rendered unnecessary in super-efficient homes. Ceiling fans coupled with natural ventilation may be sufficient in providing thermal comfort in the north of England. Ultimately, not planning for future overheating and cooling systems could create a new performance gap in design, construction and occupant behaviour. Practical application: Overheating, already experienced in dwellings throughout the United Kingdom and projected to increase in occurrence, should be considered in all new design and retrofit. Dwellings designed to meet thermal comfort performance targets may be at risk of non-compliance as a result of a warming climate. Furthermore, dwellings designed to meet energy performance targets may be at risk of non-compliance as a result of potential need for cooling systems.

The intelligent glazed facade is capable of controlling the thermal, solar and mass transmittance by controlling shutters, blinds and openings. The facade and building services are designed and controlled holistically to optimize the indoor comfort (thermal, visual comfort and indoor air quality) and minimize the energy demand by heating, cooling, lighting and ventilation. The study is conducted numerically utilising a simplified hourly calculation method developed to calculate yearly energy and comfort performance of an office room equipped with an intelligent facade. The simplified method is verified by the Danish dynamic building simulation tool BSim and experimental test in a full scale test facility at Aalborg University (Cube). Results show that the annual primary energy demand of an office building with intelligent glazed facade can be reduced by approx. 60% compared with the same building with a static facade.

Implementation of a relatively aggressive carbon tax leads to improved PM2.5 air quality compared to the reference case as incentives increase for facilities to install flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies. However, less capital is available to install NO reduction technologies, resulting in an O-3 increase.

The methodology accomplished a preliminary consistency analysis of DSW data, followed by determining per capita of DSW, annual variation rates of absolute values and per capita of DSW, correlation analysis for the year 2010 between DSW per capita and variables representing income, education, energy and water per capita consumption, and three future scenarios of DSW collection were traced until 2030. It was estimated an increase of 32.4% for the total DSW collected in the period 2003-2010, reaching in 2010 an equivalent to 0.806 kg.person(-1).day (-1), which is coherent with an earlier study that has monitored three single-family residences in the city. Such an increase is consequence not only of the population growth (15.1%), but also due to intensification in goods consumption. The relationship between DSW production and consumption patterns was highlighted by the strong correlation found between per capita of collected DSW and per capita of energy consumption, education and income variables. This corroborates the need of a cultural change regarding consumption, misuse and discard of solid waste towards environmental sustainability. If the rate of solid waste generation keeps growing, it is projected between 0.85 and 1.88 kg.person(-1).day (-1) about 2030, which will increase the challenge of collecting the DSW, landfill disposing and management, and the need of actions to mitigate potential environmental impacts.",WOS:000357414200011,2030,"{wast, manag, solid}",517
176,"There is currently a lack of international harmonization on the insulation requirements for the buildings. Given that this parameter defines the maximum energy losses allowed through a thermal envelope, building energy consumptions can vary considerably between countries. Both the United States of America (US) and the European Union (EU) should address this problem by unifying the energy design criteria of their buildings. The EU requires that all new buildings constructed starting in 2020 must be nearly zero-energy buildings (nZEB), as defined in the Directive on Energy Efficiency in Buildings of 2010.To evaluate the extent of this lack of harmonization, in this paper are calculated the maximum energy losses through the thermal envelope of a typical dwelling when applying various international regulations (such as the US regulations and those established by Germany, France, England and Wales, and Spain). The results are compared with those obtained when applying the requirements of the Passivhaus standard (taken as a reference for nZEB in the EU). It will be verified that there are major differences in the energy losses allowed through building envelopes among these countries and among the different climate zones defined in each country.Moreover, the challenges set by these countries related to energy consumption and CO2 emissions are also reviewed.

In order to provide decision-making support for the development and implementation of mitigation policy, our undesirable slack based measure (SBM) model is firstly applied to evaluate the industrial CO2 emission efficiency under total-factor frame (TFICEE) in 13 prefecture-level cities of Jiangsu Province, the largest CO2 emitter in China. Then, we analyze space-time distribution and distributional evolution tendency of TFICEE by using the GIS visualization method and kernel density estimation, respectively. Finally, we utilize the industrial abatement model to estimate the CO2 abatement potential of Jiangsu's industrial sector. The empirical results show that there exists a significant spatial inequality of TFICEE across various regions in Jiangsu, but the regional disparity has been narrowing during our study period. Additionally, average annual industrial CO2 emission reductions in Jiangsu Province can attain 15,654.00 (ten thousand tons), accounting for 28.2% of its average annual actual emissions, which can be achieved by improving production technology, adjusting industrial structure and raising the level of industry concentration.",WOS:000380760400105,2020,"{emiss, carbon, ghg}",383
178,"To cope with global warming, China has promulgated Enhanced actions on climate change: China's intended nationally determined contributions and will start the national carbon emissions trading market in 2017. Carbon emissions are distributed by the form of free quota and paid quota. However, few literatures have focused on how the economy and the environment would be changed by the change of free quota ratio. This paper establishes the 10 scenarios of different free quota ratio of carbon emissions rights and uses a dynamic, recursive computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to simulate the carbon emissions trading market, to explore the relationship between free quota ratio and carbon trading price, and the impact of carbon trading scheme (ETS) on China's economy and environment. The results show that free quota ratio will not have a direct impact on gross domestic product (GDP) and other economic and environment indicators but carbon trading prices. The prices and the rate of free payment in the current pilot cities in China are still relatively conservative. It is possible to reach emission peak, 8.21 billion ton, in 2025 and accumulative CO2 reduction from 2017 to 2030 is 20.02 billion tons, or 59.60% of 2010 world's total CO2 emission. Cement, minerals, electricity and nonferrous metals under ETS will suffer great losses, so subsidy should be considered. Finally, we suggested that China should reduce the total carbon rights to increase the carbon price in 2017, and gradually reducing the proportion of free quota, from 90% in 2017 to 50% or less in 2030, by which the peak year of CO2 emission can meet in 2025. We also suggest that ETS is an effective strategy for CO2 reduction and the ratio should be gradually reduced in ETS to prevent violent fluctuation of carbon price in China. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

181,"To improve quality of life as well as the adaptive capacity in the city of Rotterdam over the past 15 years there has been a lot of focus on improving green infrastructure and finding new ways for integrated planning. As many cities face similar challenges they are looking for novel approaches in urban ecosystem governance. The Rotterdam case can be an interesting example but can also reveal new questions to be researched.Before local policies and projects where developed a regional and urban green blue vision of how to improve overall quality of life using green infrastructure were developed. This provided policy frameworks for politicians, policymakers and other actors. Later on the same was done with Urban Waterplan 2, using the Rotterdam Watercity 2030 vision document as a basis. This vision was the result of a stakeholder based planning process which was made for the International Architecture Biennale 2005. Within these frameworks many interesting projects have been built and tested in the city and city region; ranging from a) a roof park over a railway yard to connect neighbourhoods to the waterfront, to b) water squares and c) digging new waterways with connected walking and biking routes. To go from projects to an overall implementation at city level required tools and approaches for better decision making. For the 'Dakpark' project as well as for the Zomerhofkwartier, the first climate proof neighbourhood in the city, stakeholder sessions were held and plans were drawn together with urban planners and landscape architects. To feed these processes even better and to know what would be an optimal solution for certain challenges, city data were studied and linked to scalable GIS mapping in the 'smart city planner'. This tool gives the decision maker the possibility to quickly have an overview of an area and can be used in a stakeholder process to provide relevant additional information and to define joint projects. The tool makes it possible to do this for all 90 neighbourhoods in the city.Overall the urban ecosystem governance in the city of Rotterdam has - with trial and error- lead to a series of innovative projects. The next steps are acceleration and scaling up to city and regional level. Valuing the crucial role of green blue infrastructure for several aspects of the quality of life in cities are paramount.

182,"Defining carbon emission allocation standards is becoming increasingly important for China to achieve its emission reduction targets, and support global climate change mitigation and energy constraints. This paper defines and adopts the principle of equal historical cumulative emissions per capita, and uses Shanghai as a case study to build an allocation standard for carbon emissions. First, using China's emission reduction targets, we established the carbon emission space for 2020, then constructed an allocation standard for Shanghai carbon emissions for 2020. We found that Shanghai's total carbon emissions between 2000 and 2013 had exceeded China's average carbon emissions, driven by a traditional economic development model. These results point to the necessity of reducing carbon emissions from 2011 levels effectively. The carbon emission per capita has become increasingly faster since 2012. Finally, we provide policy suggestions for low-carbon development, from the perspectives of industry structure, institutional innovation, low-carbon technology, incentive mechanisms, and new energy supplies. This study's methods can be applied to other regions to build an allocation standard for carbon emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

183,"To ensure European Union (EU) commitments to the Kyoto protocol, on 29 January 2008 the European Commission launched the Covenant of Mayors (CoM). This is an initiative aimed at unilateral and voluntary participation of European cities in energy efficiency improvement, renewable energy source usage increase, and greenhouse gas emission reduction by 2020. The Municipality of Genoa, Italy, joined the initiative on February 2009 and its Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP), aimed at a 23.7% CO2 reduction by 2020, has been the first among European cities to be officially published by the European Commission. Following a description of EU environmental policies concerning the energy sector and related regulatory framework, this paper presents issues of CoM and SEAP from an overall standpoint and their application in the city of Genoa. The SEAP approach and criteria, initially considered at a general level, are then analyzed in detail with their operational consequences regarding the city. The Baseline Emission Inventory for the city, preparation of the SEAP, its implementation in the various sectors involved (buildings, renewable energy sources, transport, public policy, and others) are analyzed. Eventually, the SEAP monitoring strategy is addressed, considering assessment of the implemented actions, biennial monitoring report, and dynamic management of the CoM. In this way, a useful benchmark is provided to those facing this issue and, more generally, to those dealing with the management of energy sustainability at various levels.

However, as the final leg of any public transport journey is generally on foot, the provision of walking and road-crossing facilities has been accelerated to meet the diverse needs of pedestrians - ranging from small children to senior citizens and the disabled. This paper describes the physical measures that have been used to make pedestrian facilities in Singapore barrier-free, safe and secure. These include lighting of all facilities at night, sheltered footpaths, kerb-cut ramps when footpaths meet carriageways, raised zebra crossings, extensions of crossing times for senior citizens using concession fare-cards, special alarms at pedestrian signals for the visually handicapped, and ramps, escalators and lifts in addition to staircases for access to pedestrian bridges and underpasses. Whereas it is possible to make new pedestrian facilities barrier-free, retrofitting older facilities poses problems.

Pursuing co-benefits is an effective approach to simultaneously respond to both carbon and air pollutant problems. In this paper, the AIM/CGE (Asia-Pacific Integrated Assessment Model/Computational General Equilibrium) model and GAINS (Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies)-China model are combined together to project future CO2 and air pollutants emissions in China, as well as reduction costs and co-benefit effects. Considering implementation of carbon mitigation policy and air pollutant mitigation technologies, four scenarios (S1, S2, S3 and S4) are analyzed. Results indicate that by implementing both carbon and air pollutant mitigation (S4), CO2 emission per GDP can be reduced by 41% by 2020, compared with the 2005 level, and SO2, NOx and PM2.5 emissions would change by a factor 0.8, 1.26 and 1.0 of the 2005 level, respectively in 2030.

Currently, 45% of municipal sewage enters a treatment plant, so a significant fraction of untreated or partially treated water is discharged or used for crop irrigation. This has significant impacts on public health and the environment. In this context, the proper selection of treatment technologies may be an important opportunity for contributing to the ambitious national greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction goals in Mexico. Based on actual infrastructure data, the scenarios analyzed in this work show that emission reductions from sewage treatment plants in Mexico could be as high as 34% when compared to the baseline scenario, depending on the treatment technologies. The results show that the anaerobic + aerobic scenario is a better option than the full aerobic scenario, as it would achieve a 4% GHG emission reduction by the year 2030. Moreover, if methane is used for in situ electricity cogeneration in larger facilities, the reduction reaches 27% versus the full aerobic scenairo.

192,"This study analyses the impact of integrated mass rapid transit system (IMRTS) and other policy measures on air emissions from vehicular sources in Delhi region. The impacts have been studied for the passenger and goods vehicles separately. For this purpose three alternative scenarios for the passenger vehicles and two alternative scenarios for the goods vehicles have been analysed for the year 2021. The interventions include stringent source emission norms, modal shift resulting from introduction of effective public transport alternatives, speed regulation measures and hiking of parking fee of private vehicles. These scenarios have been compared to the base year 2007. An important finding that emerged from the study is that stringent fuel emission norms and introduction of alternative public transport systems alone may not result in the modal shift and hence reduction in exhaust emissions. It is actually a combination of these measures and management measures such as increased parking fee and regulated uniform speed of public transport that results in desired benefits. Further, the inclusion of goods vehicle demand during transport policy formulation can help in controlling air pollution in new urban centres in India and in major developing regions of the world.

How the ZEB requirement is defined has large implications for the choice of energy technology when considering both cost and environmental issues. This paper presents a methodology for determining ZEB buildings' cost optimal energy system design seen from the building owner's perspective. The added value of this work is the inclusion of peak load tariffs and feed-in tariffs, the facilitation of load shifting by use of a thermal storage, along with the integrated optimisation of the investment and operation of the energy technologies. The model allows for detailed understanding of the hourly operation of the building, and how the ZEB interacts with the electricity grid through the characteristics of its net electric load profile. The modelling framework can be adapted to fit individual countries' ZEB definitions. The findings are important for policy makers as they identify how subsidies and EPBD's regulations influence the preferred energy technology choice, which subsequently determines its grid interaction. A case study of a Norwegian school building shows that the heat technology is altered from HP to bio boiler when the ZEB requirement is applied. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

194,"The State of Maryland aims to double its transit ridership by the end of 2020. The Maryland Statewide Transportation Model (MSTM) has been used to analyze different policy options at a system-wide level. Direct ridership models (DRMs) estimate ridership as a function of station environment and transit service features rather than using mode-choice results from large-scale traditional models. They have been particularly favored for estimating the benefits of smart growth policies such as transit-oriented development (TOD) on transit ridership and can be used as complements to the traditional four-step models for analyzing smart-growth scenarios at a local level. They can also provide valuable information that a system-level analysis cannot provide. For example, DRMs can provide ridership estimate when densifying either households or employment at certain stations to test the effectiveness of TOD strategies at target stations. In this study, the authors developed DRMs of rail transit stations, namely light rail, commuter rail, Baltimore metro, and Washington DC Metro for the State of Maryland. Data for 112 rail stations were gathered from a variety of sources and categorized by transit service characteristics, station built-environment features, and social-demographic variables. The results suggest that impacts of the built environment differ for light rail and commuter rail. For light rail stations, employment at 0.8km (half-mile) station areas, service level, feeder bus connectivity, station location in the Central Business District (CBD), distance to the nearest station, and terminal stations are significant factors influencing ridership. For commuter rail stations, only feeder bus connections are found to be significant. The DRM results have implications for agencies aiming to increase transit ridership through leveraging the land use near transit-station areas. The results show that stations with higher employment were observed to have higher transit boardings. Thus, agencies desiring to increase transit ridership should consider zoning regulations and site-design requirements that allow denser development around transit stations. However, increasing densities must be in conjunction with improved transit service levels, parking, and feeder bus services to take full advantage of rail transit. Some of the limitations of the current study and future research directions Include, first, that the DRMs were developed for the State of Maryland only. Future research should be carried out for surrounding regions to get generalized conclusions. Second, other important factors should be incorporated in the model, such as safety and transit reliability attributes.

195,"Various land-use configurations are known to have wide-ranging effects on the dynamics of and within other city components including the transportation system. In this work, we particularly focus on the complex relationship between land-use and transport offering an innovative approach to the problem by using land-use features at two differing levels of granularity (the more general land-use sector types and the more granular amenity structures) to evaluate their impact on public transit ridership in both time and space. To quantify the interdependencies, we explored three machine learning models and demonstrate that the decision tree model performs best in terms of overall performance good predictive accuracy, generality, computational efficiency, and ""interpretability"". Results also reveal that amenity related features are better predictors than the more general ones, which suggests that high-resolution geo-information can provide more insights into the dependence of transit ridership on land-use. We then demonstrate how the developed framework can be applied to urban planning for transit-oriented development by exploring practicable scenarios based on Singapore's urban plan toward 2030, which includes the development of ""regional centers"" (RCs) across the city-state. Results show an initial increase in transit ridership as the amount of amenities is increased. This trend, on the other hand, eventually reverses (particularly during peak hours) with continued strategic increase in amenities; a tipping point at 55% increase is identified where ridership begins to decline and at 110%, the predicted ridership begins to fall below current levels. Our in-silico experiments support one of the medium-term land-use transport goals of stakeholders to alleviate future strains in the transportation system of Singapore through the development of RCs. The model put forward can serve as a good foundation in building decision-support tools that can assist planners in better strategizing and planning land-use configurations, in particular the amenity resource distribution, to influence and shape public transportation demand.

197,"Along with rapid development of economy, urbanization and industrialization in China, the transportation sector especially road transport accounts for the quickest growth of energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across the country. This paper selects four representative cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing) in the north, east, south, and west of China as targets of case study. It predicts future motor vehicle population in various cities using the Gompertz Model, and predicts and analyzes fuel consumption and GHG emissions of different types of motor vehicles in the case cities by 2035. The results indicate that besides gasoline and diesel, in the future uses of various types of vehicle fuels will follow different patterns among these four cities due to diverse resources endowment, economic strength, technology levels and geographical features. Based on predicted vehicle population and fuel consumption, it is found that from 2013 to 2035, GHG emissions from tank to wheel (TTW) and well to wheel (WTW) in all cities will continuously increase yet at different rates. If there is no interference from new policies, around 2020 Chongqing is expected to replace Beijing as the city with the highest volume of GHG emissions of vehicles among four case study cities.

198,"Along with rapid development of economy, urbanization and industrialization in China, the transportation sector especially road transport accounts for the quickest growth of energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across the country. This paper selects four representative cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing) in the north, east, south, and west of China as targets of case study. It predicts future motor vehicle population in various cities using the Gompertz Model, and predicts and analyzes fuel consumption and GHG emissions of different types of motor vehicles in the case cities by 2035. The results indicate that besides gasoline and diesel, in the future uses of various types of vehicle fuels will follow different patterns among these four cities due to diverse resources endowment, economic strength, technology levels and geographical features. Based on predicted vehicle population and fuel consumption, it is found that from 2013 to 2035, GHG emissions from tank to wheel (TTW) and well to wheel (WTW) in all cities will continuously increase yet at different rates. If there is no interference from new policies, around 2020 Chongqing is expected to replace Beijing as the city with the highest volume of GHG emissions of vehicles among four case study cities. Therefore, the four cities especially Chongqing need urgently to develop or adjust low-carbon policies in road transportation sector, in order to achieve China's future greenhouse gas reduction targets. Some policy implications to reduce GHG emissions of the road transportation sectors of the case cities are suggested based on the analysis results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

199,"Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is one of the most important instruments for making relevant decisions on the basis of which spatial planning is aligned with the tenets and principles of sustainable spatial development. Its primary application is in spatial (strategic) and urban planning, as well as in the planning and design of sectoral policies in the areas of energy, water management, waste management, transport, etc. The implementation of SEA allows developers to establish the benefits and implications of the proposed spatial changes, taking into account the capacity of the space to sustain the planned development, and to determine the degree of acceptability of the proposed spatial changes. This paper presents a specific method of assessing the impact of airport noise as part of a particular SEA. The particularity of this method is that it integrates the objectives, indicators and criteria for assessing the impact of airport noise on the population using the method of multi-criteria evaluation, applied in the preparation of the SEA for the Urban development plan regarding the expansion of Tivat Airport, Montenegro. The changes in noise intensity within the planning horizon to 2030 were predicted taking into account the following factors: physical, geographic and demographic characteristics of the space, the projected increase in the number and nature of the flights operated within the planning period, as well as the types of aircraft. On the basis of these data noise dispersion modelling was carried out using the IMMI model, and the results obtained were used in a multi criteria evaluation as part of the SEA. The results of the research do not indicate any significant increase in noise intensity within the planning period to 2030 and they represent a good basis for making relevant decisions regarding the future development of Tivat Airport.

202,"The large (26-fold over the past 25 years) increase in the on-road vehide fleet in China has raised sustainability concerns regarding air pollution prevention, energy conservation, and climate change mitigation. China has established integrated emission control policies and measures since the 1990s, including implementation of emission standards for new vehicles, inspection and maintenance programs for in-use vehicles, improvement in fuel quality, promotion of sustainable transportation and alternative fuel vehicles, and traffic management programs. As a result, emissions of major air pollutants from on-road vehicles in China have peaked and are now declining despite increasing vehicle population. As might be expected, progress in addressing vehicle emissions has not always been smooth and challenges such as the lack of low sulfur fuels, frauds over production conformity and in-use inspection tests, and unreliable retrofit programs have been encountered. Considering the high emission density from vehicles in East China, enhanced vehicle, fuel and transportation strategies will be required to address vehicle emissions in China. We project the total vehicle population in China to reach 400-500 million by 2030. Serious air pollution problems in many cities of China, in particular high ambient PM2.5 concentration, have led to pressure to accelerate the progress on vehicle emission reduction. A notable example is the draft China 6 emission standard released in May 2016, which contains more stringent emission limits than those in the Euro 6 regulations, and adds a real world emission testing protocol and a 48-h evaporation testing procedure including diurnal and hot soak emissions. A scenario (min considered in this study suggests that increasingly stringent standards for vehicle emissions could mitigate total vehicle emissions of HC, CO, NOx and PM2.5 in 2030 by approximately 39%, 57%, 59% and 79%, respectively, compared with 2013 levels. With additional actions to control the future light-duty passenger vehicle population growth and use, and introduce alternative fuels and new energy vehicles, the China total vehicle emissions of HC, CO, NOx and PM2.5 in 2030 could be reduced by approximately 57%, 71%, 67% and 84%, respectively, (the PC[2] scenario) relative to 2013.

205,"Urban population in India has increased significantly from 62 million in 1951 to 378 million in 2011 in six decades. It is estimated to reach 540 million by the year 2021. This reflects on likely pressure on urban transportation system. The situation necessarily calls plans for balanced personal and public transport system. Mandatory trips bear more importance in this regard owing to their higher share in urban trips. Mode share and their choice behaviour in estimation of such trips play vital role in analysing and boosting sustainable transportation. Logit modelling approach is the conventional method generally adopted for analysing mode choice behaviour, which is based on the principle of random utility maximization derived from econometric theory. However, such models cannot address uncertainity prevailing in the choice decisions. On the contrary, fuzzy logic bypasses the binary crisp derivations of the inputs and accepts multivalued inputs in linguistic expressions, which make possible to resemble the human behaviour closely. Therefore, the attempt here is to develop fuzzy logic based mode choice model for education trips, which constitutes a good share in mandatory trips by covering various income groups of Indian society.",WOS:000362223600006,2021,"{travel, mode, choic}",332
206,"Land-use and transport systems are an important determinant of carbon dioxide emissions from urban regions. It is often asserted that urban compaction is the spatial policy best able to constrain travel and emissions, but evidence supporting this assertion is limited, particularly with respect to the combined emission from transport and land use. Here, using land-use - transport interaction models, a residential dwelling type model, and transport and emission models, we forecast and assess carbon dioxide emissions from transport, dwellings, and commercial space to 2031 for a range of spatial strategies realistically investigated for three English regions of decreasing size (the Wider South East region, Tyne and Wear, and Cambridge). Our results reveal that compaction can reduce emission relative to other spatial scenarios but that the differences are small, about 5% between extremes, an order of magnitude less than emission growth observed over the trend period. Form has more influence for settlements where the pattern and proximity of employment, housing, and services can make cycling, walking, and public transport provision more feasible. We conclude that pricing and technology measures offer better prospects for combating the growth in carbon emissions of urban regions, but that the type of urban form delivered is likely to be a significant determinant in the type of clean energy technology that can be implemented.",WOS:000297141900013,2031,"{emiss, carbon, ghg}",383
207,"This article focuses on the results obtained by the enforcement of a original greenhouse gas emissions policy, issued in recent years in several municipalities in Northern Italy. The Municipality of Reggio Emilia was one of the firsts in Italy to develop and adopt a voluntary building energy-consumption certification method called Ecoabita, aiming to promote energy efficiency in buildings over its jurisdiction. Several reasons make this project innovative: first, the certification method has been processed through and verified by a quality international agency, secondly the procedure is assisting financial-incentive policies both on mandatory (European Directive 2002/91/CE) and voluntary basis (Municipality Protocol Ecoabita), finally it allows to obtain eligible credits for avoided emissions that can be negotiated on the CO(2) exchange market. With specific reference to Reggio Emilia case, acknowledged the amount of actions, that are normally scheduled in the municipality throughout a year, it has been evaluated the benefit, in terms of environmental improvement, descended from the protocol, also projecting their trend in future years up to 2020 as well, demonstrating the scheduled interventions are fundamental in sought of the achievement of the Kyoto and Copenhagen commitments. The entire procedure has been developed in accordance to the parameters given by UNFCCC for these kinds of analyses and has been recently confirmed to be one of the most accurate international accounting procedure by a survey developed by the scientific committee of the European Project LIFE-LAKS.

208,"In recent times, climate change has emerged as one of the most challenging political and scientific issues of our times. The Brundtland Report and Rio Conference highlighted the significance of local actions as means of securing global sustainable development. This is further emphasized by the projection that 70% of the world's population will live in cities by 2050 (UN-HABITAT, 2008). With ever increasing trends in urban consumption and production practices, a call for action against climate change is often seen as a way to foster sustainable development. Considerable attention is now being paid to determine what urban sustainability would include.OECD (n.d.) says that ""cities are centres of innovation and can advance clean energy systems, sustainable transportation, waste management and spatial development strategies to reduce greenhouse gases. With access to up to date climate science, impacts and vulnerability assessment, local authorities can also work with local stakeholders to design and implement effective adaptation strategies.""In present times however, cities try to respond to climate change through programs and initiatives in the absence of any integrated, continuous and long-term strategy. To change this situation, we propose that programs and initiatives must be financially beneficial to all stakeholders. Collaboration between local government, local businesses and residents is a necessary condition. Success depends on creating a balanced win-win situation for all stakeholders.This paper looks at how political, business and individual responses can be integrated in a conceptual model that positively addresses climate change in a municipal context and is also fiscally sustainable.

This increase becomes more dramatic toward the end of the twenty-first century as the anticipated impact of climate change intensifies. The health impact associated with different emissions scenarios is also examined.

The current unreasonable waste disposal patterns and potential energy value of urban wastes necessitates the promotion of waste-to-energy implementation. This study is intent on discovering the complete energy, economic and environmental potentials of urban wastes taking municipal solid wastes, waste oil, organic wastewater and livestock manure into consideration. A waste-to-energy system is constructed incorporating these wastes and five waste-to-energy technologies. A novel input-output simulation model is developed and applied to a metropolis to introduce the waste-to energy system into the current socioeconomic system and form five waste-to-energy industries. The trends in waste generation and energy recovery potential, economic benefits and greenhouse gas mitigation contribution for the study area are estimated and explored from 2011 to 2025. By 2025, biodiesel production and power generation could amount to 72.11 thousand t and 1.59 billion kW h respectively. Due to the highest energy recovery and the most subsidies, the organic wastewater biogas industry has the highest output and net profit, followed by the waste incineration power generation industry. In total 17.97 million t (carbon dioxide-equivalent) accumulative greenhouse gas emission could be mitigated. The organic wastewater biogas industry and waste incineration power generation industry are more advantageous for the study area in terms of better energy, economic and environmental performances. The methods presented and the quantified energy, economic and environmental potentials of urban wastes are expected to provide local decision makers with options for sounder waste management.

Reflecting alternative policy goals, building energy codes differ significantly across the United States, the European Union, and China. This review uncovers numerous innovative practices including greenhouse gas emissions caps per square meter of building space, energy performance certificates with retrofit recommendations, and inclusion of renewable energy to achieve nearly zero-energy buildings'. These innovations motivated an assessment of an aggressive commercial building code applied to all US states, requiring both new construction and buildings with major modifications to comply with the latest version of the ASHRAE 90.1 Standards. Using the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS), we estimate that by 2035, such building codes in the United States could reduce energy for space heating, cooling, water heating, and lighting in commercial buildings by 16%, 15%, 20%, and 5%, respectively.

217,"Background: Climate change is a global threat to health and wellbeing. Here we provide findings of an international research project investigating the health and wellbeing impacts of policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in urban environments.Methods: Five European and two Chinese city authorities and partner academic organisations formed the project consortium. The methodology involved modelling the impact of adopted urban climate-change mitigation transport, buildings and energy policy scenarios, usually for the year 2020 and comparing them with business as usual (BAU) scenarios (where policies had not been adopted). Carbon dioxide emissions, health impacting exposures (air pollution, noise and physical activity), health (cardiovascular, respiratory, cancer and leukaemia) and wellbeing (including noise related wellbeing, overall wellbeing, economic wellbeing and inequalities) were modelled. The scenarios were developed from corresponding known levels in 2010 and pre-existing exposure response functions. Additionally there were literature reviews, three longitudinal observational studies and two cross sectional surveys.Results: There are four key findings. Firstly introduction of electric cars may confer some small health benefits but it would be unwise for a city to invest in electric vehicles unless their power generation fuel mix generates fewer emissions than petrol and diesel. Second, adopting policies to reduce private car use may have benefits for carbon dioxide reduction and positive health impacts through reduced noise and increased physical activity. Third, the benefits of carbon dioxide reduction from increasing housing efficiency are likely to be minor and co-benefits for health and wellbeing are dependent on good air exchange. Fourthly, although heating dwellings by in-home biomass burning may reduce carbon dioxide emissions, consequences for health and wellbeing were negative with the technology in use in the cities studied.Conclusions: The climate-change reduction policies reduced CO2 emissions (the most common greenhouse gas) from cities but impact on global emissions of CO2 would be more limited due to some displacement of emissions. The health and wellbeing impacts varied and were often limited reflecting existing relatively high quality of life and environmental standards in most of the participating cities; the greatest potential for future health benefit occurs in less developed or developing countries.",WOS:000371896300001,2020,"{emiss, carbon, ghg}",383
218,"The gap between calculated and actual energy use has long be recognized as a major hurdle for a realistic assessment of buildings' performance and anticipated benefits from energy conservation measures, especially when attempting a national building stock analysis. A multinational European effort to develop a conceptual framework for monitoring the effectiveness of energy retrofit measures applied in the European housing sector has motivated a number of national pilot actions. This paper presents the results from the work carried out in Greece and elaborates a methodology for deriving different empirical adaptation factors that relate the normative calculated heating energy consumption from energy performance certificates (EPC) with the actual energy use. To gain some additional insight, the work is complemented by evidence from field surveys to collect actual energy use data from dwellings before and after refurbishment and behavioural surveys of occupants. The derived factors are used to adapt the predictions, which are then organized according to the Hellenic residential building typology. The overall approach is used with a building stock model to demonstrate a preliminary assessment of different energy conservation measures, towards meeting the national targets for 2020 and 2030. The ratio of actual to calculated primary energy consumption using the processed EPC data from over 8500 dwellings, averages 0.56 (i.e. 44% lower energy use than calculated). Findings from field surveys of occupant behavioural changes in the operation of space heating systems, confirm poor indoor thermal comfort conditions resulting from reduced operating hours of space heating, lower thermostat settings etc., which deviate significantly from normative calculation assumptions. Other field data on actual energy use before and after refurbishment provide additional insight for adapting the predicted savings as a result of common retrofit actions. Popular measures include for older buildings the installation of double glazed windows, the replacement of heat production systems and roof thermal insulation. On average, the weather corrected actual primary heating energy savings are about 21% by installing double glazed windows and about 18% by replacing an oil-fired boiler with a new natural gas unit.

219,"Building sector consumes a significant amount of energy worldwide (up to 40% of the total global energy); moreover, by the year 2030 the consumption is expected to increase by 50%. One of the reasons is that the performance of buildings and its components degrade over the years. In recent years, energy benchmarking for government office buildings, large scale public buildings and large commercial buildings is one of the key energy saving projects for promoting the development of building energy efficiency and sustainable energy savings in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Benchmarking would increase the purchase of energy efficient equipment, reducing energy bills, CO2 emissions and conventional air pollution. This paper focuses on energy benchmarking for shopping centers in Gulf Coast Region. In addition, this paper will analyze a sample of shopping centers data in Gulf Coast Region (Dubai, Ajman, Sharjah, Oman and Bahrain). It aims to develop a benchmark for these shopping centers by highlighting the status of energy consumption performance. This research will support the sustain ability movement in Gulf area through classifying the shopping centers into: Poor, Usual and Best Practices in terms of energy efficiency. According to the benchmarking analysis in this paper, the shopping centers best energy management practices in the Gulf Coast Region are the buildings that consume less than 810 kW h/m(2)/yr, whereas the poor building practices are the centers that consume greater than 1439 kW h/m(2)/yr. The conclusions of this work can be used as a reference for shopping centres benchmarking with similar climate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

220,"Rising population, income and urbanization are increasing urban passenger transport demand in India. Energy and emissions intensities associated with conventional transport are no longer sustainable vis-a-vis energy security, air quality and climate change. Cities are seeking transport roadmaps that jointly mitigate these risks. Roadmaps vary across cities, but approach to delineate actions is common: (i) 'representative vision' that articulates long-term goals, (ii) methods for comparative scenarios assessment, and (iii) quantification of co-benefits to prioritize actions. This paper illustrates application of quantitative modeling to assess development and environmental co-benefits for Ahmedabad city. The paper constructs two transport scenarios spanning till 2035. The bifurcating themes are: (i) Business-as-Usual (BAU) and Low Carbon Scenario (LCS). The quantitative assessment using Extended Snapshot (ExSS) Model shows that transport activity shall result in four-fold increase in energy demand under BAU from 2010 to 2035. Three key contributors to CO2 mitigation under LCS in merit order are: (i) fuel switch, including decarbonized electricity, (ii) modal shift, and (iii) substitution of travel demand. Scenarios analysis shows that LCS improves energy security by reducing oil demand and also delivers air quality co-benefits - reducing 74% NOx and 83% PM2.5 from the passenger transport sector compared to BAU in 2035. Finally, the paper argues that cities in developing countries can leverage carbon finance to develop sustainable and low carbon mobility plans that prevent adverse infrastructure and behavioral lock-ins and prompt low carbon development.

But assessments of the economics of urban climate mitigation are lacking, and are currently based on selective case studies or specific sectors. Further analysis is crucial to enable action at the urban level. Here we consider the investment needs associated with 11 clusters of low carbon measures that could be deployed across the world's urban areas in a way that is consistent with a broader 2A degrees C target. Economic assessment of these low carbon measures finds that they could be deployed around the world with investments of c$1 trillion per year between 2015 and 2050 (equivalent to 1.3% of global GDP in 2014). When the direct savings that emerge from these measures due to avoided energy costs are considered, under the central scenario these investments have a net present value of c$16.6 trillion USD in the period to 2050. However, discount rates, energy prices and rates of technological learning are key to the economic feasibility of climate action, with the NPV of these measures ranging from -$1.1 trillion USD to $65.2 trillion USD under different conditions.",WOS:000383615200023,2050,"{emiss, carbon, ghg}",383

225,"The Mediterranean basin is a global hotspot of biological diversity and the most rich biodiversity region in Europe. Nevertheless, climate-driven habitat loss is one of the most serious concerns for biodiversity conservation in this region. We assess Mediterranean habitat loss and conversion into arid habitat under scenarios of climate change and evaluate protected areas, including Natura 2000 sites, which will be affected by these changes. We mapped shifts of Mediterranean and arid domains using four bias corrected simulations from Regional Climate Models for two emission scenarios over this century, dis-aggregated to a 1 km grid size. Our results indicate that by the end of the century the Euro-Mediterranean domain is projected to shift into other climatic domains by an area equivalent to 53 -121% of its current size. However it is projected to lose 11-25% of its current extent, which represents an area close to the size of Greece and Portugal combined. The loss is entirely due to shifts of the arid domain. Additionally, our results indicate that the extent of the arid domain is projected to increase by 228-450% of its current size in the European region. The shrinking of the current Euro-Mediterranean domain is projected to affect 15-23% of the Mediterranean Natura 2000 sites, and the loss in these sites is projected at 13-30% of its current area. Loss is projected to occur in central and southern areas of the Iberian Peninsula, southern Italy and the island of Sicily, south-eastern Greece, Cyprus, Malta and central Turkey. Computed changes in projected climatic parameters indicate that current areas of the Euro-Mediterranean domain will be hotter and drier. Temperature increase and precipitation decrease are projected to be more marked in the summer half of the year. As early as in the 2020s annual temperature is projected to increase by 0.9-1.4 degrees C with respect to the present reference climate, reaching an increase of 2.2-3.6 degrees C by the end of the century. By this period, summer precipitation is projected to decrease by 24-46% and annual precipitation by 14-23%. We provide insight into several aspects of adaptation and management of Mediterranean protected areas. A proactive approach taking into consideration landscape connectivity and the concomitant threats triggered by climate change is a priority. Proactive adaptation and management promoting investments in Green Infrastructure and a denser network of interconnected protected areas are necessary instruments for preserving Mediterranean biodiversity from the threats of habitat loss.

226,"Residential buildings in Greece account for about 79% of the exclusive-use building stock and consume about a quarter of the total final energy consumption, with space heating and domestic hot water being the main energy end-uses. About 58% of the dwellings were constructed before the 80 s and the adoption of the first thermal insulation regulation. This paper presents the results from the Hellenic pilot action within EPISCOPE. The overall approach and analysis are based on the national TABULA residential building typology for single- and multi-family houses in order to estimate heating energy performance and savings. The work exploits Census and statistical data for defining the Hellenic building stock and empirical adaptation factors to make more realistic estimates from normative calculations. The analysis is supported by a detailed data disaggregation in terms of the number of dwellings and floor areas, based on envelope thermal characteristics, heat production units, energy carriers, use of renewables etc. The calculation results are adapted for the building types and then projected to the building stock.

However, the regional scenario specifically for cities is also increasing in importance since SSPs are described as being of a global scale. Based on the projected world's pathways which are defined by SSPs, this paper attempts to develop Tokyo's long-term socioeconomic scenarios. Firstly, important factors and elements were investigated through literature reviews, and then a basic theoretical framework was developed. Secondly, expert interviews were conducted to gather more relevant narratives and elements based on the theoretical framework.Three alternative Tokyo future pathways by 2050 were established. The Local Vitality scenario and the Efficiency scenario belong to the sustainability scenario in the SSPs, with a comparison with the business as usual (BAU) case. An important feature of such a city-scale scenario is to address urban form elements and infrastructure. The elements used for Tokyo can be applied for other cities. Projecting the future is fraught with a number of uncertainties, however, describing possible pathways can provide significant support for developing sustainable mechanisms for society as a whole. This work can lay the groundwork for developing further quantitative approaches to examine strategies for reducing environmental and societal impacts in different pathways. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Participatory strategic planning enabled by scenario methods can be an important tool to guide this transformation, but methods for qualitative scenario analysis supporting stakeholder participation must be further developed and tested in the context of different cities. This paper presents results from integration of urban energy system modelling into the participatory strategic planning process implemented in the city of NE, which suffers problems typical of the heating sector in Serbia and the Western Balkans. The aim was to explore how the scenarios developed by local stakeholders could transform the NB heating system by 2030. Five scenarios developed within participatory backcasting project and a BAU scenario were analysed in terms of decarbonisation, energy security and energy efficiency using Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP). A final scenario ""Efficiency for the green future"" designed by the stakeholders for implementation in the city included high standards of energy efficiency in buildings, increased share of renewables in the heating energy mix, expanding the district heating system, deploying smart technologies and green architecture. The LEAP model demonstrated that this final scenario could lead to achievement of the desirable future vision developed by stakeholders for NB, through substantial improvements in energy efficiency and energy security, and to considerable emissions decreases by 2030 in comparison with the base year (2010) and the BAU scenario.

To demonstrate this, both in-depth interviews and questionnaires to key Austrian stakeholders are implemented. The information collected in both participatory techniques are then used to run a conflict prevention analysis.

234,"By 2050, up to 75% of people globally will live in cities. Despite the potential ramifications of this urbanization for ecosystem services (ES), and the importance of locally produced ES for the health and wellbeing of urban residents, syntheses addressing the underlying ecology of ES provision rarely include urban areas. Here, I conduct a quantitative review of urban ES studies in the ecological literature, synthesizing trends across the discipline. I also quantify the extent to which this work considers the organisms and ecosystem components responsible for ES provision using two approaches: assessment of biodiversity-ES relationships, and an adaptation of the service provider concept. The majority of urban ES studies were conducted in western, developed countries, and typically assessed a single service in a single city - largely ignoring ES synergies and tradeoffs, and cross-city comparisons. While several different ES are studied in urban ecosystems, the field is dominated by weather and climate-related regulating services, with assessments of cultural services particularly lacking. Most studies described a habitat type as the service provider; however, studies that considered the biodiversity-ES relationship were more likely to identify a specific functional group, community, or population as the key provider of an ES. The biodiversity-ES relationship itself was most frequently characterized as dependent on the composition of species, functional traits, or structures, rather than correlated with the magnitude of any specific biodiversity metric. While the study of ES in urban ecosystems is increasing, there exists considerable room for further research. Future studies would benefit by expanding the number and categories of ES assessed within and across cities, as well as broadening the geographical scope of urban ES research. Biodiversity-ES assessments in urban ecosystems would also benefit from an expansion of the biodiversity types considered, particularly regarding non-species based approaches, and consideration of non-native and invasive species.",WOS:000377212000002,2050,"{urban, land, citi}",321
235,"This paper assesses comparable urban transport scenarios for China and India. The assessment methodology uses AIM/End-use model with a detailed characterization of technologies to analyze two scenarios for India and China till the year 2050. The first scenario assumes continuation and enhancement, in both countries, of policies under a typical business-as-usual dynamics, like constructing metros, implementing national fuel economy standards, promoting alternate fuel vehicles and implementing national air quality standards. The alternative, low carbon scenario assumes application, in both countries, of globally envisaged measures like fuel economy standards as well as imposition of carbon price derived from a global integrated assessment modeling exercise aiming to achieve global 2 degrees C temperature stabilization target. The modeling results for both countries show that decarbonizing transport sector shall need a wide array of measures including fuel economy, low carbon fuel mix including low carbon electricity supply. The comparison of China and India results provides important insights and lessons from their similarities and differences in the choice of urban transport options. India can benefit from China's experiences as it lags China in urbanization and income. Modeling assessments show that both nations can contribute to, as well as benefit by aligning their transport plans with global climate stabilization regime. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, optimization of the urban industrial structure is urgently required to pursue the low-carbon goal under the constraints of water supply. In this paper, we chose Dalian city in China as a case study and divided its industrial sectors into three types according to their output value. Meanwhile, we used the LMDI (Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index) method to decompose the factors that impact industrial carbon emissions from energy consumption. Based on the ratio of the carbon emission effects, five scenarios were set respectively, and accounted for the carbon emissions and water consumption under different scenarios of industrial structure. The results indicated that the economic growth effect was the most significant factor that contributed to industrial carbon emissions, while industrial structure effect was the largest negative factor for increasing industrial carbon emissions. The results also indicated that the total carbon emissions under the HOV (high output-value)-preferred and water-conserved scenario will be lower by 8.5% in 2020 than the baseline scenario, while both its energy intensity and water intensity will meet the requirements of the constraints of the urban development planning.

So far few studies have focused on the practical road map to the national target of energy use on the city/district level and to the communication aspects with stakeholders in the creation of energy city models.In this paper a city energy model is developed based on the requests and need for visualization from a group of energy advisors. Six different scenarios are studied in order to analyze the possibility of reaching the energy targets specified by the government in the town of Kiruna. The results show that: (1) it is possible to automatically create city energy models using extract, transform and load tools based on spatial and non-spatial data from national registers and databases; (2) city energy models improve the understanding of energy use in buildings and can therefore be a valuable tool for energy advisors, real estate companies and urban planners. The case study of Kiruna showed that the proposed energy saving measures in the energy performance certificates need to be implemented and new buildings in the urban transformation must be of high energy standard in order to reach the national target in Kiruna.

Based on the preferences of transporters, we conclude that the most important measures are to develop a larger charging infrastructure and implement financial incentives through subsidies or tax exemption.

241,"After 2020, all new buildings in Europe must be built as ""nearly zero-energy buildings"" (NZEB). For residential and certain commercial building types, significant experience in both research and practice is already available for such ambitious building standards. However, for industrial buildings, such as warehouses and production buildings, NZEB is still a new field. To date findings for residential and office buildings are often used to define standards for the entire building sector. However, industrial buildings have completely different thermal behavior due to their different building shapes, materials, interior temperatures, usage times and internal gains from processes and machines. Therefore, new concepts are required for nearly zero-energy industrial buildings. In this research, such concepts were developed based on large parametric studies simulating more than 1800 different variations in a building simulation model coupled with a 3D transient finite difference ground model and an air-flow network simulation. To gain the required input data for the air infiltration simulation, extensive leakage measurements in a therefore built air-tightness test stand were conducted. According to the EU directive stipulating the NZEB standard, NZEBs have to be cost-optimal. Thus, the focus of this work was on developing cost-optimal solutions to meet the NZEB standard. The results are building concepts for warehouses and production buildings that have 50-75% lower heat energy demand than current (2015) building standards in Germany. These heat energy savings are primarily achieved by increased air tightness, decreased thermal bridges, optimized floor slab insulation and solar optimization. Significantly increased insulation thicknesses are only cost-effective for industrial buildings with low internal gains but relatively high interior temperatures. Previous standards almost exclusively concentrated on increasing the thermal insulation, while the other parameters were often neglected. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

242,"The objective of this study is to provide a strategic evaluation of the mitigation of CO2 emissions via modal substitution of high-speed rail for short-haul air travel on the Sydney Melbourne, Australia city-pair from a life cycle perspective. It has been demonstrated that when considering CO2 emissions from vehicle operations, the modal shift from air to high-speed rail on this city-pair has the potential to provide a means of CO2 mitigation. However, uncertainty exists with regard to the level of mitigation potential when considering the whole-of-life performance of the systems. Given the significant difference in the infrastructure requirements between the air mode and the high-speed rail mode, this study quantifies the life cycle CO2 load attributable to each system and examines the effect on CO2 mitigation potential. The study concluded that while the inclusion of the linehaul infrastructure did increase the CO2 load associated with high-speed rail mode, it did not equate to or exceed the CO2 load per trip as experienced by the air mode. The avoided annual life cycle CO2 emission in the target year 2056 was 037 Mt representing an 18% reduction when compared to the air mode only on the city pair. In fact, the scenario comparison indicated that the substitution of high-speed rail for short-haul air travel on the city pair resulted in CO2 emissions avoidance throughout the longitudinal period.

Increasing public transportation ridership shares compared to drive alone transportation mode would therefore be a giant step toward more environmentally friendly and stress-free cities, and so this study aims to propose possible public transportation policies to be adopted by policy makers or urban planners. Although public transportation is one of the sub-sections of urban planning, it has a wide variety of aspects that affect local societies and the environment, so a system dynamics approach is used to model and simulate the most realistic and practical CO2 mitigation scenarios for U.S. cities by adopting public transportation policies for future years. Based on historical data and applicable model validation processes, the behavior of the U.S. commuters' transportation mode choice and the potential of transit transportation to mitigate CO2 emissions are both forecasted for future-years up to 2050 under several possible policy scenarios. The results indicate that, in order to decrease fuel consumption and CO2 emission trends, marginal and ambitious scenarios should be implemented. For instance, increasing public transportation ridership by 9% has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions by 766,000 tonnes annually in 2050, whereas a 25% increase in ridership could potentially reduce cumulative CO2 emissions by 61.3 million tonnes.

245,"The combination of climate change and urbanization projected to occur until 2050 poses new challenges for land-use planning, not least in terms of reducing urban vulnerability to hazards from projected increases in the frequency and intensity of climate extremes. Interest in investments in green infrastructure (interconnected systems of parks, wetlands, gardens and other green spaces), as well as in restoration of urban ecosystems as part of such adaptation strategies, is growing worldwide. Previous research has highlighted the insurance value of ecosystems in securing the supply of ecosystem services in the face of disturbance and change, yet this literature neglects urban areas even though urban populations are often highly vulnerable. We revisit the insurance value literature to examine the applicability of the concept in urban contexts, illustrating it with two case studies: watersheds providing drinking water for residents of Vancouver, Canada; and private gardens ensuring connectedness between other parts of urban green infrastructure in London, UK. Our research supports the notion that investments in green infrastructure can enhance insurance value, reducing vulnerability and the costs of adaptation to climate change and other environmental change. Although we recommend that urban authorities consider the insurance value of ecosystems in their decision-making matrix, we advise caution in relying upon monetary evaluations of insurance value. We conclude by identifying actions and management strategies oriented to maintain or enhance the insurance value of urban ecosystems.

246,"This paper considers the financial costs of a rapid national transition to electric vehicles (EVs) in comparison to a baseline scenario that is characterised by continuing use of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEs). The Australian car fleet, which is responsible for 8% of national greenhouse emissions, is used as a case study. To explore the potential range of costs associated with rapid climate mitigation via the transport sector, the transition is assumed to occur very rapidly (by 2025). The analysis focusses on urban areas, where extensive charging infrastructure is assumed to be made available, including rapid charging facilities. Due to uncertainty over input variables, two ""boundary"" scenarios were constructed. In the High Cost Scenario, a rapid shift to EVs was found to cost approximately 25% more than the continuing use of ICEs, assessed over the period 2015-2035. However, in the Low Cost Scenario, where costs of EVs (especially batteries) fall more rapidly, EV maintenance costs are at the lower end of projections, and liquid fuel costs at the higher end of projections, a rapid transition to EVs is found to cost approximately the same as the use of ICE vehicles. This suggests that a rapid transition towards EV technologies for urban car travel may offer a cost-effective second-best climate change mitigation strategy. More comprehensive transport sector transformation, including changes in transport and land use policy designed to facilitate mode shift, might further reduce the costs of such a transition.

248,"The concept of passive and low energy houses became fashionable in the last years and the European Parliament also initiated a proposal to build only near zero energy houses from 2018. The regulations already in force aim at low energy consumption (most likely influenced by the wide spreading of the ""Passivhaus"" concept in Europe) and by 2018 harmonized regulations and standards will require the near zero energy building. According to the concept of the Energy Performance of Building Directive, this means strict limitation of the integrated specific energy consumption (measured in primary energy), which includes a variety of operational energy consumption. Some components of this consumption depend exclusively on the users' behaviors while others depend on the building and the user's interactions. The concept of near zero operational energy means that the energy needed for the building is so low that it can be - fully or mostly - covered with renewables. In other terms, it means that, during most part of the winter the building will be in a free running regime thus without using mechanical or active heating systems. On one hand, decision makers and politicians may declare their wish or aim, while on the other hand it is questionable whether the expectation of the inhabitants and the requirements of the regulations coincide.

Disadvantaged and vulnerable groups will be most affected.The environmental, social and health-related issues include: pressure on the limited arable land in Australia; increased volumes of industrial and domestic waste; inadequate essential services; traffic congestion; lack of affordable housing; declining mental health; increased obesity problems; and inadequate aged care services. Many of these factors are related to the aggravation of climate change and health inequities.It is critical that the Australian Government develops a sustainable population plan with stabilisation of population growth as an option. The plan needs to ensure adequate hospitals and healthcare services, education facilities, road infrastructure, sustainable transport options, water quality and quantity, utilities and other amenities that are already severely overburdened in Australian cities.

Three scenarios have been designed to describe future energy strategies in relation to the development of Beijing city, namely a reference scenario (RS), control scenario (CS), and integrated scenario (IS). The results show that under the IS the total energy demand in Beijing is expected to reach 88.61 million tonnes coal equivalent (Mtce) by 2030 (59.32 Mtce in 2007), 55.82% and 32.72% lower than the values under the RS and the CS, respectively. The total carbon emissions in 2030 under the IS, although higher than the 2007 level, will be 62.22% and 40.27% lower than under the RS and the CS, respectively, with emissions peaking in 2026 and declining afterwards. In terms of the potential for reduction of energy consumption and carbon emissions, the industrial sector will continue to act as the largest contributor under the IS and CS compared with the RS, while the building and transport sectors are identified as promising fields for achieving effective control of energy consumption and carbon emissions over the next two decades.

The project faces many challenges, including limited open areas for installing solar PV, increasing energy consumption challenges associated with campus energy growth and the high cost of installing solar PV. A previous study by Kwan and Hoffmann (2010) found that the LACCD would need to install a 9.5 MW solar PV array in order to meet total campus energy demand on a college campus through the year 2020. This paper attempts to evaluate the financial feasibility of such a project, taking into account the current local, state and federal renewable energy incentives available. We find that despite the availability of financial incentives by local municipal utility companies including installation rebates and net metering, the cost of electricity generated by solar PV still remains approximately 30% higher than electricity generated by fossil fuels. We also find that the optimal solar PV array size from a financial standpoint is one that is sized to generate and meet all electrical demand during sunlight hours. Any array larger than this yields diminishing returns. Finally our analysis examined the influence of per kW installation cost and found that only when prices dropped to $3.00 per installed watt did a net-zero energy solar PV array have an NPV of 0.

This study used recently available data on bus system performance, travel characteristics, and emissions factors to estimate the emissions savings from public bus services in two cities, Ahmedabad and Bangalore. Three types of emissions savings estimates were calculated: past savings from increased ridership in the 5 years from 2005 to 2010, current savings from the newly introduced Janmarg bus rapid transit system in Ahmedabad and the Big10 trunk services in Bangalore, and forecasted savings for 2021 and 2031.

We have then applied the adapted ELCC framework to the case study of the domestic sector of the city of Bologna (Italy), identifying and prioritizing several efficiency measures. Measures were evaluated through their capital investment, annual values of savings, payback period and reduction in consumption, and then aggregated in different scenarios in order to highlight potential urban investments and to showcase a possible approach to the prioritization of demand side water efficiency measures.

The results show that, with an upfront investment of (sic) 17 million, a feasible subset of Bologna's households could be equipped with five selected cost-effective measures, generating annual savings of (sic) 10.2 million and reducing the total domestic water consumption of 34% by 2020 compared to the 2012 initial value. With additional (sic) 28.5 million, households could be equipped with more costly appliances reaching an overall water reduction of 37% by 2020. Our findings confirm that it is possible to successfully extend current approaches to urban energy efficiency strategies to include demand side water efficiency, adding an important building block to the construction of an integrated Nexus-based approach to green development strategies at the city-level. We encourage further tests to confirm the robustness of the methodology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",WOS:000370900400008,2020,"{water, heat, suppli}",145
264,"To develop a scenario, easily traceable even for ordinary citizens, toward the national challenge target of 80% CO2 reduction by 2050, we have proposed a new model that calculates the total CO2 emission based on the final consumption. Using the model, we have tested appropriate (locally available) technology based sub-scenarios: (1) energy saving through electrification of all transportation; (2) promotion of wood utilization for housing; (3) introduction of renewable energies; and (4) efficient energy recovery from wastes. Applying the scenarios to the Kyoto-city as a case study, we have found that local 80% CO2 emission reduction could be possible using appropriate technologies including emission reduction from construction of private and public infrastructures, and shifting our final consumption mode into low CO2 emission has a significant impact. We have also argued that it is of interest to examine the future socio-economic change that would influence on people's consumption behavior. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

265,"This paper estimates and analyzes the historical and future trends of energy demand and environmental emissions from passenger transportation of the Kathmandu Valley covering CO2, CO, HC, NOx, SO2, total suspended particles (TSP) and lead (Pb). It uses the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System framework for constructing future scenarios up to year 2020 and analyzing their implications; these scenarios mainly deal with the traffic improvement measures, promotion of public transportation and electric vehicles. The results estimate over a four-fold increase in energy demand in 1988-2000. TSP increase of 4.5 times in this period is the major concern since high particulate concentration is already above World Health Organization guidelines. Under the non-intervention scenario, energy demand in 2020 is estimated to be 2.7 times that in the year 2000. Similarly, 2.5 times increase of TSP in 2020 from the year 2000 is estimated that would further increase the TSP concentrations. The scenario analyses suggest that increasing vehicle speed, promoting public transportation and promoting electric vehicles could reduce energy demand by 28%, 28% and 18%, respectively, while promoting a reasonably comfortable condition on overcrowded public transportation could increase energy demand by 10% from non-intervention scenario.

269,"The issue of a peak in world oil supply has become a mainstream concern over the past several years. The petroleum geology models of post-peak oil production indicate supply declines from 1.5% to 6% per year. Travel requires fuel energy, but current transportation planning models do not include the impacts of constrained fuel supply on private travel demand. This research presents a method to assess the risk to activities due to a constrained fuel supply relative to projected unconstrained travel demand. The method assesses the probability of different levels of fuel supply over a given planning horizon, then calculates impact due to the energy supply not meeting the planning expectations. A new travel demand metric which characterizes trips as essential, necessary, and optional to wellbeing is used in the calculation. A case study explores four different urban forms developed from different future growth options for the urban development strategy of Christchurch, New Zealand to 2041. Probable fuel supply availability was calculated, and the risk to transport activities in the 2041 transport model was assessed. The results showed all the urban forms had significantly reduced trip numbers and lower energy mode distributions from the current planning projections, but the risk to activities differed among the planning options. Density is clearly one of the mitigating factors, but density alone does not provide a solution to reduced energy demand. The method clearly shows how risk to participation in activities is lower for an urban form which has a high degree of human powered and public transport access to multiple options between residential and commercial/industrial/service destinations. This analysis has led to new thinking about adaptation and reorganization of urban forms as a strategy for energy demand reduction rather than just densification. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

270,"Throughout Asia, rapid and uncontrolled urbanization has created serious environmental problems, and the development of sustainable urban-rural planning methods is of critical importance. To improve our understanding of mixed urban-rural land uses and provide future practical visions for regional planning, we conducted a case study of the urban fringe of the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, Thailand. After identifying local irrigation districts as the basic spatial unit for resource circulation, we quantified current material flows of organic wastes generated by households within each district. We then developed two different land-use scenarios for 2020: (1) a high-rise compact and (2) a low-story sprawl development scenario. These scenarios were compared in terms of efficiency of material flows and energy consumption. We found that, based on current infrastructure and technology, the latter scenario was more advantageous in terms of both material input and energy consumption than the former, thereby, identifying positive aspects of urban-rural land-use mixture. Based on these results, we propose that planners should focus on density control measures that take into account bioresource circulation within irrigation districts rather than simply drawing arbitrary land-use zoning lines. To this end, we suggest that the division between agricultural and urban planning departments must be bridged, and that research should take an interdisciplinary approach.",WOS:000279227200008,2020,"{urban, land, citi}",321
271,"Based on a systematic analysis of Beijing's Urban Transportation-Environment Systems (UTES), an integrated model is built, seeking an optimized and feasible trip mode structure on the premise of resident trip demands, environmental and resource capacity, and feasibility of policy adjustment in Beijing. First, a system dynamics model and a linear optimization model are founded for the Business-as-Usual simulation and best results of transportation development. Next, eight ameliorated scenarios combining four policies on Clean Transportation, Bus Priority, Subway Priority, and Car Trip Restriction are re-simulated. Finally, the results from nine scenarios are compared with the optimized results through grey correlation assessment. Findings show that adjustment policies have positive effects on the improvement of UTES, although these are varied and occur at different time scales. Integrated adjustment measures for sustainable transportation should be employed in Beijing because a combination of policies yields better effects than individual regulations. The derived optimized trip mode structures of Beijing in 2020 for subways, taxis, cars, buses and bicycling or walking are 19.41, 2.58, 24.99, 32.57 and 20.46% respectively, while daily resident trips reach 59.5 million.

272,"Building on previously introduced concepts and software, we constructed an interlinked system of models, called an ""integrated model project,"" for assessing integrated effects of supply-side and demand-side technologies and policies for carbon dioxide (CO(2)) mitigation in urban areas. We used the integrated model project to evaluate scenarios that included introduction of a solid oxide fuel cell combined with a gas turbine topping cycle (SOFC/GT) as a supply-side technology and reduction of electricity demand by energy conservation and rooftop photovoltaic (PV) cells in residential and commercial buildings as a demand-side measure in Tokyo, Japan. Modeling results indicate that integrating multiple supply-side and demand-side countermeasures can result in more effective mitigation of CO(2) emissions. In particular, although separately a moderate CO(2) tax and the SOFC/GT technology do not produce large CO(2) mitigation, the combination of the two with PV installation could result in a 50% reduction in CO(2) emissions in 2050. Cancellation effects of combinations of supply-side and demand-side measures were also seen between supply-side SOFC/GT systems and demand-side rooftop PV cells, effects that might not be apparent without the integrated environmental assessment approach that we have adopted. An integrated environmental assessment approach using tools such as those described in this article could help researchers to assess these kinds of dynamic, nonlinear effects, which would not be predicted by conventional linear, ""additive"" approaches.",WOS:000283692700011,2050,"{emiss, carbon, ghg}",383

High rates of urban sprawl need to be reduced by increased inner-urban development while settlements have to adapt to climate change and contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions at the same time. In this study, we analyze conflicts in the management of urban areas and develop integrated sustainable land use strategies for Germany. The spatial explicit land use change model Land Use Scanner is used to simulate alternative scenarios of land use change for Germany for 2030. A multi-criteria analysis is set up based on these scenarios and based on a set of indicators.

The results show that the built-up and transport area development can be influenced both in terms of magnitude and spatial distribution to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Strengthening the inner-urban development is particularly effective in terms of reducing built-up and transport area development. It is possible to reduce built-up and transport area development to approximately 30 ha per day in 2030, which matches the sustainability objective of the German Federal Government for the year 2020.

277,"The twentieth century saw a dramatic increase in the production of urban solid waste, reflecting unprecedented global levels of economic activity. Despite some efforts to reduce and recover the waste, disposal in landfills is still the most usual destination. However, landfill has become more difficult to implement because of its increasing cost, community opposition to landfill siting, and more restrictive environmental regulations regarding the siting and operation of landfills. Moreover, disposal in landfill is the waste destination method with the largest demand for land, while land is a resource whose availability has been decreasing in urban systems. Shortage of land for landfills is a problem frequently cited in the literature as a physical constraint. Nonetheless, the shortage of land for waste disposal has not been fully studied and, in particular, quantified. This paper presents a method to quantify the relationship between the demand and supply of suitable land for waste disposal over time using a geographic information system and modelling techniques. Based on projections of population growth, urban sprawl and waste generation the method can allow policy and decision-makers to measure the dimension of the problem of shortage of land into the future. The procedure can provide information to guide the design and schedule of programs to reduce and recover waste, and can potentially lead to a better use of the land resource. Porto Alegre City, Brazil was used as the case study to illustrate and analyse the approach. By testing different waste management scenarios, the results indicated that the demand for land for waste disposal overcomes the supply of suitable land for this use in the study area before the year 2050.

278,"Recent economic expansion and population growth in developing countries have had a big impact on the development of large cities like Delhi, India. Accompanied by Delhi's rapid spatial growth over the last 25 years, urban sprawl has contributed to increased travel. The vehicle fleet projected at current growth rates will result in more than 13 million vehicles in Delhi in 2020. Planning and managing such a rapidly growing transport sector will be a challenge. Choices made now will have effects lasting well into the middle of the century: With such rapid transport growth rates, automobile emissions have become the fastest increasing source of urban air pollution. In India, most urban areas, including Delhi; already have major air pollution problems that could be greatly exacerbated if growth of the transport sector is managed unwisely. The transport plans designed to meet such large increases in travel demand will have to emphasize the movement of people, not vehicles, for a sustainable transportation system. Therefore, a mathematical model was developed to estimate the optimal transportation mix to meet this projected passenger-km demand while satisfying environmental goals, reducing congestion levels, and improving system and fuel efficiencies by exploiting a variety of policy options at the minimum overall cost or maximum welfare from transport. The results suggest that buses will continue to satisfy most passenger transport in the coming decades, so planning done in accordance with improving bus operations is crucial.",WOS:000181584700006,2020,"{transport, public, access}",295
279,"On May 2008, Kyoto city government set up a low-carbon target of a 50% GHG reduction by 2030 compared to the 1990 level. To contribute to these discussions, we developed a local (city-scale) low-carbon scenario creation method. An estimation model was developed to show a quantitative and consistent future snapshot. The model can explicitly treat the uncertainty of future socio-economic situations, which originate from the openness of local economy. The method was applied to Kyoto city, and countermeasures to achieve the low-carbon target were identified. Without countermeasures, emissions would increase 12% from 2000. Among the measures, the reduction potential of energy efficiency improvements to residential and commercial sectors was found to be relatively large (15% and 18% of total reductions, respectively). The reduction potential of the passenger transport sector, in which the city government's policy is especially important, was 17% of the total amount. A sensitivity analysis showed that a 10% increase in exports leads to an 8.5% increase in CO(2) emissions, and a 20% increase in the share of the commuters from outside the city leads to a 3.5% decrease of CO(2) emissions because of the smaller number of residents in the city.

280,"Large-scale, dedicated commercial biomass energy systems are a potentially large contributor to meeting global climate policy targets by the end of the century. We use an integrated assessment model of energy and agriculture systems to show that, given a climate policy in which terrestrial carbon is appropriately valued equally with carbon emitted from the energy system, biomass energy has the potential to be a major component of achieving these low concentration targets. A key aspect of the research presented here is that the costs of processing and transporting biomass energy at much larger scales than current experience are explicitly incorporated into the modeling. From the scenario results, 120-160 EJ/year of biomass energy is produced globally by midcentury and 200-250 EJ/year by the end of this century. In the first half of the century, much of this biomass is from agricultural and forest residues, but after 2050 dedicated cellulosic biomass crops become the majority source, along with growing utilization of waste-to-energy. The ability to draw on a diverse set of biomass-based feedstocks helps to reduce the pressure for drastic large-scale changes in land use and the attendant environmental, ecological, and economic consequences those changes would unleash. In terms of the conversion of bioenergy feedstocks into value added energy, this paper demonstrates that biomass is and will continue to be used to generate electricity as well as liquid transportation fuels. A particular focus of this paper is to show how climate policies and technology assumptions - especially the availability of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technologies - affect the decisions made about where the biomass is used in the energy system. The potential for net-negative electric sector emissions through the use of CCS with biomass feedstocks provides an attractive part of the solution for meeting stringent emissions constraints: we find that at carbon prices above $150/tCO(2), over 90% of biomass in the energy system is used in combination with CCS. Despite the higher technology costs of CCS, it is a very important tool in controlling the cost of meeting a target, offsetting the venting of CO2 from sectors of the energy system that may be more expensive to mitigate, such as oil use in transportation. CCS is also used heavily with other fuels such as coal and natural gas, and by 2095 a total of 1530 GtCO(2) has been stored in deep geologic reservoirs. The paper also discusses the role of cellulosic ethanol and Fischer-Tropsch biomass derived transportation fuels as two representative conversion processes and shows that both technologies may be important contributors to liquid fuels production, with unique costs and emissions characteristics.

It brings together scholars from diverse schools working on new areas of research and application in urban design and planning. Emergent research agendas include both novel areas of research and important shifts in the direction of a research area. The challenge for planning schools is to reflect critically on these changes and develop long-term research agendas that can better position our field in society and academia, and provide a basis from which to assess our academic programmes. The chapters in this issue display the different scales and fields of planning, including planning for: disaster recovery; climate change, especially opportunities for mitigation; shrinking cities in the First World; and rapidly urbanising informal and impoverished cities in the global South. At the same time, the chapters identify research areas that respond to major social and environmental changes. Olshansky and Chang highlight the increasing losses from catastrophic disasters, and address the need for disaster recovery planning. Wheeler, Randolph and London focus on climate change, and, noting the urgency of action now, their research agenda emphasises opportunities for planners to develop research and policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hollander, Pallagst, Schwarz and Popper look at increasing economic and population trends in many First World cities that result in city 'shrinkage'.

284,"Forecasting urban futures is of great importance to ensure the adequate provision of public and private services and to implement policies that guide demand while mitigating negative impacts. This study produces year 2030 predictions of land use and travel conditions across the Austin-Round Rock statistical metropolitan area of Texas by integrating a gravity-based land use model (modeled on Putman's Integrated Transportation-Land Use Package specification) with a standard travel demand model. The land use model cycles through job, household, and land consumption estimates across traffic analysis zones before feeding forward into a contemporaneous model of travel patterns. To understand the implications of different policies better, three scenarios were generated: a business-as-usual scenario, a congestion pricing plus carbon tax scenario, and an urban growth boundary (UGB) scenario. Results reveal how these transportation and land use policies may shape our land and travel futures, and they illuminate challenges and pitfalls of the gravity-based approach to land use (including the accompanying land consumption model). Of particular interest is that the imposition of road pricing (roughly 5(sic)/mi) had almost no discernable effect on land use predictions, yet resulted in the same predicted reduction in regional vehicle miles traveled as the UGB policy (roughly 15%).",WOS:000274376500013,2030,"{urban, land, citi}",321
285,"Although several central and local governments around the world have set long term low-carbon targets, they do not always have concrete plans toward the goals. In order to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emission significantly, various kinds of measures in various sectors will be required. Some measures reduce GHG emissions directly and are called ""direct measures"" in this study. To implement those direct measures by the target year, indirect measures are also required, such as economic incentives, regulations, and urban planning. This study proposes a method to develop a concrete long-term schedule of direct and indirect measures, a ""roadmap,"" based on the idea of backcasting. To formulate the implementation of and relations between measures, and to estimate the concrete schedule to achieve the targets, we developed a model called ""backcasting tool"" (BCT). Given the information of measures including GHG emission reduction by measures, required resource input and maximum total resource input, and so on, BCT estimates the progress of the measures from the current to the target year. The method was applied in Kyoto City with a low-carbon target, 40% reduction in CO(2) emission from fossil fuel by 2030 compared with 1990. Using BCT, we showed that a detailed schedule consists of about 100 measures classified into six fields. The result shows it is possible to achieve the target if all the measures, both direct and indirect, are implemented in time. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

289,"This article examines the future role of energy efficiency as a resource in the Western US and Canada, as envisioned in the most recent resource plans issued by 16 utilities, representing about 60% of the region's load. Utility and third-party-administered energy-efficiency programs proposed by 15 utilities over a 10-year horizon would save almost 19,000 GWh annually, about 5.2% of forecast load. There are clear regional trends in the aggressiveness of proposed energy savings. California's investor-owned utilities (IOUs) had the most aggressive savings targets, followed by IOUs in the Pacific Northwest, and the lowest savings were proposed by utilities in Inland West states and by two public utilities on the West Coast. The adoption of multiple, aggressive policies targeting energy efficiency and climate change appears to produce sizeable energy-efficiency commitments. Certain specific policies, such as mandated energy savings goals for California's IOUs and energy-efficiency provisions in Nevada's Renewable Portfolio Standard, had a direct impact on the level of energy savings included in the resource plans. Other policies, such as revenue decoupling and shareholder incentives and voluntary or legislatively mandated greenhouse gas emission reduction policies, may have also impacted utilities' energy-efficiency commitments, though the effects of these policies are not easily measured. Despite progress among the utilities in our sample, more aggressive energy-efficiency strategies that include high-efficiency standards for additional appliances and equipment, tighter building codes for new construction and renovation, as well as more comprehensive ratepayer-funded energy-efficiency programs are likely to be necessary to achieve a region-wide goal of meeting 20% of electricity demand with efficiency in 2020.",WOS:000207998400001,2020,"{energi, build, consumpt}",779
290,"Momentum has been building for an EU-wide approach to energy policy in which energy end-use efficiency is regarded as one of the main planks. Member States are already obliged to plan for the achievement of energy savings targets in respect of the period 2008-2016 and they now face additional economy-wide targets for 2020. Efficiency investments are widely regarded as capable of improving industrial competitiveness, security of energy supply and the abatement of greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, the design of policy packages may involve trade-offs between these objectives. The challenge for energy modellers is to quantify future energy savings associated with combinations of efficiency measures. This paper draws on the international experience in energy modelling and tracks recent progress that has been made towards a harmonised European framework for verification of savings. It points to the significant development work that remains to be done, particularly to enable an increased reliance on bottom-up evaluation methods. One significant gap in our knowledge relates to the required adjustment of technical savings due to behavioural factors such as rebound effects. The paper uses one country (Ireland) as a case study to demonstrate how a framework is being developed to respond to these new requirements. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

291,"It is essential to the achievement of zero waste that emphasis is concentrated on front-end preventions rather than end-of-pipe (EOP) treatment. Zero waste is primarily based on cleaner production, waste management, the reduction of unnecessary consumption and the effective utilization of waste materials. The aim of this study was to briefly review the tasks undertaken and future plans for achieving zero waste in Taiwan. Waste prevention, source reduction, waste to product, waste to energy, EOP treatment, and adequate disposal are the sequential principal procedures to achieve the goal of zero waste. Six strategies have been adopted to implement the zero waste policy in Taiwan. These are regulatory amendments, consumption education, financial incentives, technical support, public awareness, and tracking and reporting. Stepwise targets have been set for 2005, 2007, 2011, and 2020 for both the municipal solid waste (MSW) and industrial waste to reach the goal of zero waste. The eventual aim is to achieve 70% MSW minimization and 85% industrial waste minimization by 2020. Although tools and measures have been established, some key programmes have higher priority. These include the establishment of a waste recycling programme, promotion of cleaner production, a green procurement programme, and promotion of public awareness. Since the implementation of the zero waste policy started in 2003, the volume of MSW for landfill and incineration has declined dramatically. The recycling and/or minimization of MSW quantity in 2007 was 37%, which is much higher than the goal of 25%. Industrial waste reached almost 76% minimization by the end of 2006, which is 1 year before the target year.",WOS:000275332600005,2020,"{wast, manag, solid}",517

Many of them extend beyond traditional state department of transportation (DOT) activities and span of control. There is an interconnection between transportation and land use that the public and local decision makers do not often see. Yet the public frequently holds DOTs responsible for solving transportation problems resulting from local and regional land use decisions and preferred development patterns. The objective of this research is to identify and explore successful innovations in integrating transportation and land use planning for transportation corridors, with a focus on practices that could be transferred to other locations. A case study approach was used to identify projects that integrated, rather than merely linked, land use and transportation planning and decision making.

What is now beginning to be realised is that this approach can also help mitigate the impacts of global climate change (GCC) and provide assistance to city dwellers in adapting to the changes which have already occurred. By using case studies from around the world, this paper illustrates how vegetated SUDS devices can sequester and store carbon, cool urban areas and increase perceptions of health and well-being in the populace. Both vegetated and hard-engineered structures can evaporate water contained within them and are thus being used in cities to cool the overlying air. Also shown is the extent to which SUDS devices such as green roofs and wet pavements are being used to mitigate the urban heat island effect, which, while not caused by climate change, exacerbates its impacts. Of the houses needed by 2040 in the UK, 80% already exist.

Sixty-four percent of this carbon was attributed to soil, 20% to vegetation, 11% to landfills, and 5% to buildings. To offset rising urban emissions of carbon, regional and national governments should consider how to protect or even to increase carbon storage of human-dominated landscapes.

300,"The U.S. Department of Energy has launched the commercial building initiative (CBI) in pursuit of its research goal of achieving zero-net-energy commercial buildings (ZNEB), i.e., ones that produce as much energy as they use. Its objective is to make these buildings marketable by 2025 such that they minimize their energy use through cutting-edge, energy-efficiency technologies and meet their remaining energy needs through on-site renewable energy generation. This paper examines how such buildings may be implemented within the context of a cost-or CO(2)-minimizing microgrid that is able to adopt and operate various technologies: photovoltaic (PV) modules and other on-site generation, heat exchangers, solar thermal collectors, absorption chillers, and passive/demand-response technologies. A mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that has a multi-criteria objective function is used. The objective is minimization of a weighted average of the building's annual energy costs and CO(2) emissions. The MILP's constraints ensure energy balance and capacity limits. In addition, constraining the building's energy consumed to equal its energy exports enables us to explore how energy sales and demand-response measures may enable compliance with the ZNEB objective. Using a commercial test site in northern California with existing tariff rates and technology data, we find that a ZNEB requires ample PV capacity installed to ensure electricity sales during the day. This is complemented by investment in energy-efficient combined heat and power (CHP) equipment, while occasional demand response saves energy consumption. A large amount of storage is also adopted, which may be impractical. Nevertheless, it shows the nature of the solutions and costs necessary to achieve a ZNEB. Additionally, the ZNEB approach does not necessary lead to zero-carbon (ZC) buildings as is frequently argued. We also show a multi-objective frontier for the CA example, which allows us to estimate the needed technologies and costs for achieving a ZC building or microgrid.

304,"Beyond energy efficiency, there are now urgent challenges around the supply of resources, materials, energy, food and water. After debating energy efficiency for the last decade, the focus has shifted to include further resources and material efficiency. In this context, urban farming has emerged as a valid urban design strategy, where food is produced and consumed locally within city boundaries, turning disused sites and underutilized public space into productive urban landscapes and community gardens. Furthermore, such agricultural activities allow for effective composting of organic waste, returning nutrients to the soil and improving biodiversity in the urban environment. Urban farming and resource recovery will help to feed the 9 billion by 2050 (predicted population growth, UN-Habitat forecast 2009). This paper reports on best practice of urban design principles in regard to materials flow, material recovery, adaptive re-use of entire building elements and components ('design for disassembly'; prefabrication of modular building components), and other relevant strategies to implement zero waste by avoiding waste creation, reducing wasteful consumption and changing behaviour in the design and construction sectors. The paper touches on two important issues in regard to the rapid depletion of the world's natural resources: the built environment and the education of architects and designers (both topics of further research). The construction and demolition (C&D) sector: Prefabricated multi-story buildings for inner-city living can set new benchmarks for minimizing construction wastage and for modular on-site assembly. Today, the C&D sector is one of the main producers of waste; it does not engage enough with waste minimization, waste avoidance and recycling. Education and research: It's still unclear how best to introduce a holistic understanding of these challenges and to better teach practical and affordable solutions to architects, urban designers, industrial designers, and so on. How must urban development and construction change and evolve to automatically embed sustainability in the way we design, build, operate, maintain and renew/recycle cities? One of the findings of this paper is that embedding zero-waste requires strong industry leadership, new policies and effective education curricula, as well as raising awareness (through research and education) and refocusing research agendas to bring about attitudinal change and the reduction of wasteful consumption.",WOS:000208781100008,2050,"{wast, manag, solid}",517

It is an important issue to project China's vehicle ownership, which to a large extent determines China's oil demand and GHG emissions from road transportation sector in the future. In this study, we established a hybrid model with three sub models to simulate the growth patterns of China's private passenger vehicles, urban public transport vehicles and economic utility vehicles. By using this model, we projected that China's vehicle population would reach 184.8, 363.8 and 606.7 million by 2020, 2030 and 2050 respectively. The fast increase of urban private passenger vehicles is the main driving force for vehicle population growth. Population of urban private passenger vehicles would account for 70.1%, 81.1% and 86.1% of total vehicle population in 2020, 2030 and 2050 respectively. It was demonstrated by sensitivity analysis that vehicle population was quite sensitive to household income and vehicle price, implying an effective lever for regulating the growth of vehicle population.

The future trends of PC emissions were also projected under three scenarios to explore the reduction potential of possible policy measures. Estimated baseline emissions of CO, HC, NOx, PM10 and CO2 were respectively 3.16 x 10(6), 5.14 x 10(5), 3.56 x 105, 0.83 x 10(4) and 9.14 x 10(7) tons for China's PCs in 2005 with an uneven distribution among provinces. Under a no improvement (NI) scenario, PC emissions of CO, HC, NOx, PM10 and CO2 in 2020 are respectively estimated to be 4.5, 2.5, 2.5, 7.9 and 8.0 times that of 2005. However, emissions other than CO2 from PCs are estimated to decrease nearly 70% by 2020 compared to NI scenario mainly due to technological improvement linked to the vehicle emissions standards under a recent policy (RP) scenario. Fuel economy (FE) enhancement and the penetration of advanced propulsion/fuel systems could be co-benefit measures to control CO2 and pollutant emissions for the mid and long terms. Significant variations were found in PC emission inventories between different studies primarily due to uncertainties in activity levels and/or emission factors (EF). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

312,"The building sector is regarded as having one of the highest benefit-cost ratios from greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction strategies. However, because of uncertainties around household behaviour patterns, it is very difficult to assess and compare the GHG reduction impacts of different intervention schemes for whole housing stock. Intervention schemes include policy instruments such as incentives or rebates for energy efficient appliances or renewable energy, and regulatory building code requirements for energy efficiency. This paper presents a decision support tool based on mathematical diffusion that evaluates the adoption levels of different schemes or pathways towards reducing GHG emissions in housing stock. It is an extension of the Bass diffusion model that accommodates financial and non-financial benefits, ceilings of adoption and interactions between intervention options. The model capability was tested using a case study of seven suburbs in Brisbane, Australia, comprising of 25,000 houses and units. Estimates of GHG emission reductions to 2019 of a household rebate scheme for solar panels and a rebate scheme for solar hot water compared to a base case of no rebates were presented and analysed. Modelling also allowed identification of important characteristics of adoption trends that could assist policy makers and industry to substantially improve the design of effective intervention options.

313,"For countries in the Arabian Peninsula, air conditioning (A/C) systems account for 65% of the energy consumption, all of which comes from fossil fuel. Given the preparation for the 2022 World Cup, which will be held in Qatar, the possibility of implementing ground source heat pump systems (GSHP) for A/C purposes is investigated. Due to its high thermal performance, GSHP is considered a viable solution for reducing the energy consumption of heating and A/C systems. However, for the GSHP system to gain popularity in cooling-dominated environments such as Qatar, financial and environmental benefits need to be demonstrated. These benefits strongly depend on local design practices and standards and on working conditions.The work presented in this paper demonstrates the energy savings by using GSHP systems in the residential buildings sector in cooling-dominated environments. To achieve this goal, a common type of residential house located in Doha, Qatar, was chosen as a case study. The cooling load of the case study and the driving energy of two different air conditioning systems were estimated. The two considered air conditioning systems are the conventional air source heat pump system (reference system) and the ground source heat pump system. Finally, economic analysis of the proposed system for construction practices in Qatar was carried out.The performed analyses show that the reduction in the prime energy demand and, consequently, the greenhouse gas emissions for the GSHP is 19% when compared to the conventional air source heat pump system. In addition, the analyses show that for the local conditions in Qatar the payback time of GSHP is 9 years. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

318,"Heat pumps play a central role in decarbonising the UK's buildings sector as part of the Committee on Climate Change's (CCC) updated abatement scenario for meeting the UK's fourth carbon budget. However, the UK has one of the least developed heat pump markets in Europe and renewable heat output from heat pumps will need to increase by a factor of 50 over the next 15 years to be in line with the scenario. Therefore, this paper explores what lessons the UK might learn from Finland to achieve this aim considering that its current level of heat pump penetration is comparable with that outlined in the CCC scenario for 2030. Despite the two countries' characteristic differences we argue they share sufficient similarities for the UK to usefully draw some policy-based lessons from Finland including: stimulating new-build construction and renovation of existing stock; incorporating renewable heat solutions in building energy performance standards; and bringing the cost of heat pumps in-line with gas fired heating via a combination of subsidies, taxes and energy RD&D. Finally, preliminary efforts to grow the heat pump market could usefully focus on properties unconnected to the gas-grid, considering these are typically heated by relatively expensive oil or electric heating technologies.

The techno-economic estimates are made using a bottom-up building stock model (ECCABS) to assess the effects and cost-efficiency of various energy efficiency measures. Common to these two modelling approaches are two scenarios of energy prices, which differ only with respect to the carbon tax component. We implement the method for the case of useful energy demand for space and water heating in the Swedish residential sector up to 2030. In comparison to the level of energy use in 2005 (74 TWh), the top-down model predicts for 2030 reductions in demand for the two price scenarios of 17 and 21 TWh respectively.

This article investigates how marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves can inform such a decision. We re-analyse a MAC curve built for Brazil by 2030, and show that misinterpreting MAC curves as abatement supply curves can lead to suboptimal strategies. It would lead to (1) under-investment in expensive, long-to-implement and large-potential options, such as clean transportation infrastructure, and (2) over-investment in cheap but limited-potential options such as energy-efficiency improvement in refineries. To mitigate this issue, the article proposes a new graphical representation of MAC curves that explicitly renders the time required to implement each measure.Policy relevanceIn addition to the cost and potential of available options, designing optimal short-term policies requires information on long-term targets (e.g. halving emissions by 2050) and on the speed at which measures can deliver emission reductions. Mitigation policies are thus best investigated in a dynamic framework, building on sector-scale pathways to long-term targets. Climate policies should seek both quantity and quality of abatement, by combining two approaches: a synergy approach' that focuses on the cheapest mitigation options and maximizes co-benefits, and an urgency approach' that starts from a long-term objective and works backward to identify actions that need to be implemented early. Accordingly, sector-specific policies may be used (1) to remove implementation barriers on negative- and low-cost options and (2) to ensure short-term targets are met with abatement of sufficient quality.

326,"There is increasing interest in the potential of cities to contribute to climate mitigation. Multiple assessments have evaluated the scale and composition of urban GHG emissions, while others have evaluated some aspects of urban mitigation potential. However, assessments of mitigation potential tend to be broadly focused, few if any have evaluated urban mitigation potential on a measure-by-measure basis, and fewer still have considered the economic case for investing in these measures. This is a significant knowledge gap as an economic case for action could be critical in building political commitment, strengthening institutional capacities, securing large-scale finance and targeting investment and implementation in cities. In this paper, we conduct a comparative analysis of the results of five recently completed studies that examined the economic case for investing in low-carbon measures in five cities: Leeds in the UK, Kolkata in India, Lima in Peru, Johor Bahru in Malaysia and Palembang in Indonesia. The results demonstrate that there is a compelling economic case for cities in both developed and developing country contexts to invest, at scale, in cost-effective low-carbon measures. The results suggest that these investments could generate significant reductions (in the range of 15-24% relative to business-as-usual trends) in urban carbon emissions over the next 10 years. Securing these savings would require an average investment of $3.2 billion per city, which if spread over 10 years equates to 0.4-0.9% of city GDP per year. However, the savings generated in the form of reduced energy bills would be equivalent to between 1.7% and 9.5% of annual city-scale GDP, and the average payback period of investments would be approximately 2 years at commercial interest rates. We provisionally estimate that if these findings were replicated and similar investments were made in cities globally, then they could generate reductions equivalent to 10-18% of global energy-related GHG emissions in 2025. While the studies offer some grounds for optimism, they also raise important questions about the barriers to change that prevent these economically attractive options from being exploited and about the scope for mitigation based on the exploitation of only the economically attractive options. We therefore discuss the institutional capacities, policy environments and financing arrangements that need to be developed before even these economically attractive opportunities can be exploited. We also demonstrate that, in rapidly growing cities, the carbon savings from such investments could be quickly overwhelmed - in as little as 7 years - by the impacts of sustained population and economic growth. We conclude by highlighting the need to build capacities that enable the exploitation not only of the economically attractive options in the short term but also of those deeper and more structural changes that are likely to be needed in the longer term.

This study focuses on the annual energy consumption for cooling offices which can be determined not only according to the calculation rules laid down in the EnEV2007 or DIN V 18599 standards but also with the aid of algorithms specified in VDI 2067 or by means of dynamic thermal simulations.

329,"Waste management activities contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions approximately by 4%. In particular the disposal of waste in landfills generates methane that has high global warming potential. Effective mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions is important and could provide environmental benefits and sustainable development, as well as reduce adverse impacts on public health. The European and UK waste policy force sustainable waste management and especially diversion from landfill, through reduction, reuse, recycling and composting, and recovery of value from waste. Energy from waste is a waste management option that could provide diversion from landfill and at the same time save a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, since it recovers energy from waste which usually replaces an equivalent amount of energy generated from fossil fuels. Energy from waste is a wide definition and includes technologies such as incineration of waste with energy recovery, or combustion of waste-derived fuels for energy production or advanced thermal treatment of waste with technologies such as gasification and pyrolysis, with energy recovery. The present study assessed the greenhouse gas emission impacts of three technologies that could be used for the treatment of Municipal Solid Waste in order to recover energy from it. These technologies are Mass Burn Incineration with energy recovery, Mechanical Biological Treatment via bio-drying and Mechanical Heat Treatment, which is a relatively new and uninvestigated method, compared to the other two. Mechanical Biological Treatment and Mechanical Heat Treatment can turn Municipal Solid Waste into Solid Recovered Fuel that could be combusted for energy production or replace other fuels in various industrial processes. The analysis showed that performance of these two technologies depends strongly on the final use of the produced fuel and they could produce GHG emissions savings only when there is end market for the fuel. On the other hand Mass Burn Incineration generates greenhouse gas emission savings when it recovers electricity and heat. Moreover the study found that the expected increase on the amount of Municipal Solid Waste treated for energy recovery in England by 2020 could save greenhouse gas emission, if certain Energy from Waste technologies would be applied, under certain conditions.

330,"The aim of this paper is to develop an approach and tools for cross-sectoral regional industrial GHG and energy policies. These policies can be conducted at different levels of society. To achieve real results in energy efficiency improvements and in GHG reductions, the policies must be focused on the correct levels in society. In Finland, the province level seems to be a reasonable level for a policy targeted at industry. This paper proposes a category for the ways industry uses energy: building energy users, major users of electricity for process/production, major users of heat for process/production and direct combustion users. This approach gives opportunities for developing regional cooperation among different industries. The approach is also important between industries and society, so that there are integrated solutions which e.g. utilise district heating and biofuel potentials. The individual technologies like electric motors, pumps, fans, heat recovery equipment and boilers do not seem to have any significant potentials for improvements in energy efficiency by the EU target year 2020. However, there are opportunities but they are at system levels: how effectively the individual technologies are applied as a part of industrial systems. This fact supports the idea of energy use categorising. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",WOS:000266629000029,2020,"{energi, build, consumpt}",779
331,"Petrol prices have been increasing and decreasing at a formidable rate. in July 2007 unleaded regular petrol in the typical Australian capital city was about A U$1.20/litre and 12 months later the price was over AU$1.60/litre. By July 2009 it was back to close to A U$1.20/litre. Despite the volatility, some long-term forecasters suggest a price as high as AU$8/litre in 2020 is not beyond the realms of reality. Despite the increases and drops in retail in petrol prices over the last three years, there is a sense of optimism in some camps that prices will rise when the global financial crisis is over, and that finally we will have pricing signals to encourage earlier investment in substitutes that include public transport, more fuel efficient cars as well as lower polluting vehicles. This note uses TRESIS, an integrated transport, land use and environmental strategy impact simulation program, to assess the influence of higher fuel prices on short run and long run passenger travel activity in Melbourne.

A multiphased evaluation process was applied to identify the most feasible near-term BRT corridors within the county, develop operating plans and infrastructure strategies, and select the preferred BRT operating and infrastructure strategies. Three corridors were prioritized for near-term BRT. The preferred operating strategy was forecast to generate 25,000 more daily riders in 2030 than the no-project scenario and showed promise to improve mobility along key arterials around San Jose, California. The BRT strategic plan was adopted by the VTA board of directors in mid-2009. VTA is moving forward with engineering and desk work on the three near-term corridors. This paper discusses the approach and processes adopted in the strategic plan that moved the BRT discussion forward. Cities in a similar incipient stage of BRT planning can heed key lessons learned to facilitate their own activities: establishing a coherent BRT vision and development process internally before reaching out to stakeholders, involving operations staff early in the development process to foster buy-in, holding frank discussions on maintaining local overlay service, and applying a specific process to develop a signature and unique BRT brand and service.",WOS:000281094600004,2030,"{brt, bus, system}",77
333,"The effects of land use and transportation policies on emissions, ozone concentrations, and a metric for population exposure were investigated for Austin, Texas. Three distinct transportation and land use scenarios were examined with a gravity-based land use model and a standard travel demand model: a business-as-usual scenario, a road pricing policy that included a flat-rate carbon-based tax and congestion pricing of all Austin-area freeways, and an urban growth boundary policy. Two scenarios, a business-as-usual scenario and a flat-rate carbon-based tax and congestion pricing policy, were also examined with a novel, parcel-level land use change and land use intensity model and a standard travel demand model. Transportation and land use policies were predicted to have substantial effects on travel and on emissions of ozone precursors. Emissions of ozone precursors decreased markedly for all 2030 scenarios because of the implementation of more stringent federal motor vehicle emission control programs. Transportation and land use policies were predicted to lead to greater reductions of emissions of ozone precursors relative to the business-as-usual scenario. The effects of such policies on ozone concentrations and population exposure vary. Lower exposure was predicted for the road pricing scenarios, but a penalty appeared to exist in the form of relatively higher exposure predicted for the urban growth boundary on some days.

For each setting, we compared a business-as-usual 2030 projection (without policies for reduction of greenhouse gases) with alternative scenarios-lower-carbon-emission motor vehicles, increased active travel, and a combination of the two. We developed separate models that linked transport scenarios with physical activity, air pollution, and risk of road traffic injury. in both cities, we noted that reduction in carbon dioxide emissions through an increase in active travel and less use of motor vehicles had larger health benefits per million population (7332 disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs] in London, and 12 516 in Delhi in 1 year) than from the increased use of lower-emission motor vehicles (160 DALYs in London, and 1696 in Delhi). However, combination of active travel and lower-emission motor vehicles would give the largest benefits (7439 DALYs in London, 12 995 in Delhi), notably from a reduction in the number of years of life lost from ischaemic heart disease (10-19% in London, 11-25% in Delhi). Although uncertainties remain, climate change mitigation in transport should benefit public health substantially.

335,"Growing environmental consciousness and rising energy prices have emphasized the need for substantial energy savings in the single-family residential building sector. To achieve this, more stringent performance requirements are needed. The intent of this work is to develop a framework and preliminary policy implementation strategy to achieve an 80% reduction in heating energy consumption by 2035 for newly constructed single-family dwellings across Ontario (Canada). A tiered framework of heating energy consumption targets was developed using current (2012) Ontario building code requirements as the baseline and building enclosure/HVAC requirements estimated as necessary to achieve the Passive House Standard in Ontario's two climate zones. An Ontario based large track homebuilder estimated construction capital costs for each tier to examine potential cost barriers against implementation. A significant cost premium of over $65 000 (CAD) (54%) exists between the baseline consumption and the overall 80% heating energy reduction target; a result of unfamiliarity and lack of experience designing and constructing to the proposed levels.

336,"By 2020, different European Directives on the energy performance of buildings (EPBD) aim to reduce energy consumption by 20%, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% and endorse a target of a 20% share of energy from renewable sources. These Directives have led EU Member States to develop systems, following their corresponding transposition into national law, to evaluate the energy efficiency of buildings, and create different Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs). This has led to different energy efficiency measurement systems in the EU and a CO2 emissions scale has not been included by some Member States. Just as EPC is aimed at influencing the demand for energy-efficient buildings, this study is aimed at developing a straightforward procedure to obtain the environmental impact in the use phase of a building in kgCO(2)/m(2) year in order to influence the demand for buildings with a low impact on climate change. By applying this methodology to different case studies, we can conclude that obtaining the formula drastically simplifies the calculation of CO2 emissions in KgCO(2)/m(2) year. The results obtained from applying this methodology will serve to record CO2 emission rates in single-family houses on a yearly basis, thus contributing to the study of applications that address climate change mitigation.

To date, these cars have not been effectively collected or recycled. Policies must be deliberately devised and reformed to facilitate state-of-the-art vehicle recycling and minimize waste arising from end-of-life cars. In this study, dynamic modeling and cost-benefit analysis have been employed to investigate how polices, including government subsidies, a value added tax and a deposit-refund system, may affect recycling of end-of-life passenger cars. The results indicate that a combination of deposits and subsidies will surpass all of the other independent policies in terms of the recycling rate. This combination is expected to lead to a recycling rate of 80% of end-of-life passenger cars by 2050. However, the government will have to pay an annual 62 billion Chinese Yuan in the middle of the century for old-for-new replacement subsidies, posing a heavy burden on public finance. Comparatively, the deposit-only scenario will cost the government 4.7 billion Chinese Yuan and elevate the recycling rate to 46% in 2050. These policies may help curb the black market and promote the legitimate business of dismantling and recycling in the long run.

A model is developed to estimate individual consumption behaviors and demand of mobility goods and non-mobility goods at micro level. By considering the economic factor of income, the energy consumption is calculated based on demand of goods under Business as usual scenario, Central Core City scenario, and Multi-pole structure scenario. Results indicate the urban structure influences individual consumption behaviors and energy consumption. Increased consumption of the non-mobility goods and mass transit trips is shown in Central Core City scenario and the Multi-pole structure scenario. Monocentric urban structures as shown in Central Core City scenario show less effect on energy consumption than the polycentric urban structure in Multi-pole structure scenario. The findings suggest that the multi-pole urban structure is a better choice for compact development in Kumamoto based on less energy consumption. The method in this study provides a new approach to analyze the influence of urban structure on energy consumption at micro level.

342,"Concern over climate change has increased the efforts for climate change mitigation in cities and companies. At the same time, the EU policies promote material and energy recovery from waste, and the production of energy from renewable sources. In the energy system, the replacement of another energy production plant with a waste to energy plant (WTE) may either increase or decrease the total emissions. Cities and companies calculate their greenhouse gas emissions or carbon footprints using various calculation protocols, and a change from landfilling to waste incineration affects the emissions of these actors in various ways depending on the system boundaries. In this contribution, impact of a change from landfilling to WTE on the emissions of different actors is calculated for the case in which WTE replaces separate production of district heat (DH) by natural gas and electricity by coal. In the case of a waste management company, emissions decreased from about 51 kt CO2-eq in 2009 (before introduction of the WTE) to -33 kt CO2-eq in 2030. Emissions of DH company decreased by 40%, whereas at the city-level the combined emissions of waste management and district heat consumption decreased 60% between 2009 and 2030. The significance of the energy source to be replaced by energy from WTE on the potential GHG emission reductions was also calculated for different options. The emissions of electricity and district heat produced by WTE were 35-60% smaller than emissions from separate production of district heat by oil or natural gas and production of electricity by natural gas or coal. When electricity and DH produced by the WTE replaced those produced by alternative CHP plants, the impact varied from increase of emissions by 50% to decrease of emissions by 40% depending on the fuel of the CHP plant and electricity source used to cover the smaller electricity generation by the WTE. However, in all the cases, when the avoided emissions from landfilling were taken into account, the emissions of WTE were smaller than those of alternative waste management and energy generation options over time.

To take advantage of electric vehicles and improve its urban environment, Beijing, as one of China's most polluted cities, launched an electric vehicle promotion program that provided a generous subsidy for consumers who purchased battery electric vehicles (BEVs). In this study, we compare the levelized costs of a conventional vehicle (CV) versus a BEV using real data from the Beijing BEV subsidy program. Levelized cost for this study considers consumer driving patterns and vehicle age. For consumers with average driving profiles-i.e., an average driving distance of around 20 km per trip-the levelized cost of CVs decreases from 1.40 yuan/km for an 8-year vehicle lifetime to 1.04 yuan/km for a 15-year lifetime, while the levelized cost for BEVs decreases from 1.44 yuan/km for an 8-year vehicle lifetime to 1.01 yuan/km for a 15-year lifetime. BEVs are more cost competitive than CVs for consumers with medium and high driving profiles and a 12-year and 15-year lifetime. Under current conditions, the subsidy and tax incentives are necessary to make BEVs cost competitive. However, we project that, even if the subsidy is phased out in 2020, BEVs may become cost competitive with CVs because of the decrease in battery cost. Our study results suggest that the BEV subsidy should reflect changes in battery cost and gasoline prices to help continuing deployment of BEVs.",WOS:000361432300013,2020,"{vehicl, electr, charg}",269

355,"Globally as well as in China, cities have contributed to most of economic output and have accordingly given rise to most of CO2 emissions. In particular, given unprecedented urbanization, cities will play an even greater role in shaping energy demand and CO2 emissions. Therefore, cities are the key to meeting its proposed carbon intensity target in 2020 and whatever climate commitments beyond 2020 that China may take. Given the paramount importance of cities, China is practicing low carbon city (LCC) development. Against this background, this paper first summarizes the general situation and main characteristics of China's LCC development. The paper then indentifies eight problems and challenges for China's LCC development including the absence of sound carbon accounting systems, lack of low-carbon specific evaluation system, rare use of market-based instruments, insufficient government-enterprise interactions, excessive budget dependence on land concession, increasing difficulty in further carbon mitigation, inevitable emissions growth due to rising living standards, and coal-dominant energy structure in the foreseeable future. Since these challenges are not applied to one or few cities, but are to all cities across the country, finally, the paper discusses how governments, in particular the central government, should address these problems and challenges. Given that China has faced great difficulty ensuring that local governments act in accordance with centrally-directed policies, the paper in particular discusses ways to incentivize local governments not to focus on economic growth alone and to move away from a heavy reliance on land concession. The paper ends with emphasizing on putting a price on carbon a crucial step for China's endeavor of harnessing the market forces to reduce its energy consumption and carbon emissions and genuinely transiting into a low-carbon economy.",WOS:000330552600009,2020,"{emiss, carbon, ghg}",383
356,"In 2009, China committed to reducing its carbon dioxide intensity (CO2/unit of gross domestic product, GDP) by 40-45% by 2020 from a s2005 baseline and in March 2011, China's 12th Five-Year Plan established a carbon intensity reduction goal of 17% between 2011 and 2015. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) of China then established a Low Carbon City policy and announced the selection of 5 provinces and 8 cities to pilot the low carbon development work. How to determine if a city or province is ""low carbon"" has not been defined by the Chinese government.Macro-level indicators of low carbon development, such as energy use or CO2 emissions per unit of GDP or per capita may be too aggregated to be meaningful measurements of whether a city or province is truly ""low carbon"". Instead, indicators based on energy end-use sectors (industry, residential, commercial, transport, electric power) offer a better approach for defining ""low carbon"" and for taking action to reduce energy-related carbon emissions.This report presents and tests a methodology for the development of a low carbon indicator system at the provincial and city level, providing initial results for an end-use low carbon indicator system, based on data available at the provincial and municipal levels. The report begins with a discussion of macro-level indicators that are typically used for inter-city, regional, or inter-country comparisons. It then turns to a discussion of the methodology used to develop a more robust low carbon indicator for China. The report presents the results of this indicator with examples for 6 selected provinces and cities in China (Beijing, Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Guangdong, and Hubei). The report concludes with a discussion of data issues and other problems encountered during the development of the end-use low carbon indicator, followed by recommendations for future improvement.

357,"While many countries have set ambitious targets for reducing energy use and GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions, it remains highly uncertain whether the policies introduced will be suitable to reach these targets at the specified times. Models used to inform building policies often do not account for the different boundary conditions related to socio-economic development, climate, composition and age structure of the existing building stock, and lifetime expectancy, which hinders effective strategy development and realistic target setting. This study presents a dynamic Type-Cohort-Time (TCT) stock-driven modelling approach that considers demographic aspects, lifestyle-related issues, and building-specific characteristics. Case studies were conducted for the dwelling stocks in Germany and the Czech Republic, two countries with different boundary conditions, but that are sheltered under the same European energy reduction policies and goals. The effects of the policies on nearly zero energy buildings and increased renovation rates were tested. The results showed that current regulations are sufficient to achieve the 20% energy efficiency goal by 2020, but not to reach the 2050 energy and GHG-emission goals. The scenarios further demonstrate that the same policies on renovation and construction in different countries lead to different energy reduction levels. Accordingly, country-specific policies and measures are suggested. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",WOS:000369191100004,2020,"{polici, instrument, effect}",129
358,"The article provides a review on Heat Pumps (HPs) implementation in Lithuania in compliance with the National Energy Strategy and European policy and encompasses the period 2005-2013 after the Lithuanian integration into the EU.Lithuania has limited quantity of indigenous energy resources and is dependent on the import of natural gas, petroleum and hard coal. Up, to 2009, Lithuania's energy dependence on the imports of fuel and energy was about 50-62%. At the end of 2009, after the decommissioning of the Lithuanian Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant (INPP), energy dependence on the imports of energy resources increased remarkably to approximately 80-82% and considerably exceeded the EU average 53-54%. The share of indigenous and renewable energy sources (RES) in gross inland fuel and energy consumption in Lithuania increased from 11.2% (RES 8.7%) in 2005 to 21.4% (RES 17.6%) in 2013. About 48% of such energy sources were transformed in Combined Heat and Power (CHP) and heat plants, 38% belonged to households and 14% - to industry and other sectors.In the article, the HPs implementation in Lithuania and European countries was overviewed. The analysis of HPs promotion in Lithuania was carried out. HP related legislation in Lithuanian and Europe was shown. Regulations on HPs installation and usage of refrigerants were disclosed. Aims and tasks of Lithuanian Heat Pump Association were indicated. The dissemination and manufacture of perspective HPs were investigated. Lithuanian HPs market characteristics and technological trends were reviewed. HPs technical segmentation in Lithuania and categories by heat collector, output (kW) and hot water production were analyzed. HPs market shares by company's brand name were compared.

360,"By the year 2050, more than 70% of the world's population will be living in cities. The rush to the cities, along with subsequent increased consumption patterns, has dire consequences, for the ecological systems that sustain human life. Some find hope in the potential that cities can be built differently, that green infrastructure and denser forms of development, will satisfy human needs while decreasing the stress on valuable resources and mitigating consequences of climate change. Some say that ""strong political leadership and robust governance"" is critical for this need to drive sustainable urban transitions. However, are ""political will"" and ""good governance"" enough or is the issue more complicated than this? Using a critical political economy approach this paper shows the fundamental difficulties that arise when attempting to transition urban centres to ""smarter"", more ""sustainable"" and ""resilient"" cities. Ultimately, the paper argues that ""good governance"" and ""strong political will"" are inadequate for understanding the requirements for transformation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

361,"The assumption that climate mitigation can only be afforded at a particular level of income is implicit in global climate negotiations. This suggests that middle-income countries may reach a tipping point in their development process where low-carbon investment becomes more viable. In order to avoid dangerous levels of climate change, this tipping point needs to be brought forward in time: upper-middle-income countries are already responsible for 37.8% of global CO2 emissions. We explore the scope for large-scale investment in climate mitigation in Johor Bahru, a fast-growing industrial city in Malaysia. We find that the city could reduce per capita emissions by 10.0% by 2025, relative to 2014 levels, through cost-effective investments. If the returns could be recovered and reinvested in low-carbon measures, Johor Bahru could reduce per capita emissions by 35.2% by 2025, relative to 2014 levels. This result suggests that the tipping point may be a function of political will and institutional capacity as well as income. This has substantial implications for global climate policy discussions, particularly the opportunities and responsibilities of middle-income countries. If comparable savings can be delivered across cities in middle-income countries, this would equate to a reduction in global emissions of 6.3% with the exploitation of cost-effective options and 11.3% with the exploitation of cost-neutral options.

363,"This paper quantitatively assesses the co-benefits of atmospheric CO2 stabilization at 400 ppmv by 2100 on air pollutants emissions from road vehicles using a global energy system model treating the road transport sector in detail. It is estimated that the reduction rate of global cumulative emissions of SO2, NOx, and PM from road vehicles during the period 2020-2100 in the 400 ppmv CO2 stabilization scenario compared to the no CO2 constraint scenario is 22.1%, 10.8%, and 14.4%, respectively. Such co-benefits are the largest for SO2 because biomass-derived Fischer Tropsch products are chosen as a major alternative fuel for road transport in the former scenario and because their SO2 emission factor is zero, whereas their NOx and PM emission factors are lower than those for petroleum products only by 27% and 21%, respectively. This implies that introducing liquid biofuels would not lead to a noticeable reduction in NOx and PM emissions. Such co-benefits are the smallest for NOx. The first reason is that, except for 2100 in the no CO2 constraint scenario, heavy-duty trucks account for the largest share of global road vehicles' NOx emissions in the two scenarios throughout the time horizon. The second reason is that in each time period, heavy-duty trucks emit almost the same amount of SO2, NOx, and PM between the scenarios because of almost the same technology and fuel choices in this sector.

366,"This article presents a dynamic spatial model of the development of a charging infrastructure for electric vehicles in the German metropolitan region of Stuttgart. The model consists of several sub-models whose functioning and interactions are explained in detail. The first sub-model simulates the time-spatial development of electric vehicle ownership. The output of this module is used by the second component that determines the resulting demand for charging stations. To quantify this demand, the necessary utilisation of charging stations to allow for the profitability of the infrastructure is calculated. A final processing step simulates the mobility of EVs throughout the Region Stuttgart, and thus allows allocating the need for charging stations in space. We used our model to generate several scenarios of the development of a charging infrastructure in the Region Stuttgart until 2020. The main finding of this work is that the number of public charging stations needed for the region in the long run is quite low. If too many charging stations are installed the infrastructure will be under-utilized and thus cannot be operated economically. The simulation runs show that the installation of public charging infrastructure should be focused on the few biggest urban centres of the region. The scenarios also show that publicly accessible charging stations form only a minor part of the overall number of charging stations. Additionally, it can be seen that the exponential growth of electric vehicle ownership, with very few vehicles at the beginning, but large gains after a few years, requires high flexibility from stakeholders involved in the implementation of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles.",WOS:000310349400004,2020,"{vehicl, electr, charg}",269
367,"Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the residential sector by adopting technologies such as solar photovoltaics and electric vehicles (EVs) have major implications for the capacity of electricity distribution networks, particularly at local areas with high uptake. Consumer decisions to purchase these technologies are also influenced by several complex criteria such as costs/benefits, performance, appeal/status, risk, psychographics, and demographics. This complexity motivated the development of an innovative diffusion model, incorporating features of multi-criteria analysis and choice modelling, to estimate the adoption of these technology options spatially across the landscape of heterogeneous consumers. We test the model to forecast market share of EVs through to 2030, using the vehicle stock across all 1.5 million households in Victoria, Australia. Seven financial and non-financial criteria were included and calibrated via focus groups and a large-scale survey. Annual change of criteria values and their elasticity to adoption were incorporated. Geographical differences in uptake of EVs were primarily due to driving distance, employment status and household income, with urban areas having about three times the proportional uptake. By testing the model for a range of incentives, we demonstrate its capability to inform and evaluate policy options. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
